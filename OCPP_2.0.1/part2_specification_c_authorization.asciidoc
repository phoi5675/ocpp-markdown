== Introduction

This Functional Block describes all the authorization-related functionalities, it contains different ways of authorizing a user, online and/or offline and the AuthorizeRequest message handling/behavior, Authorization Cache functionality, etc.

When a user wishes to unplug the electric vehicle from the Charging Station, the Charging Station needs to verify that the user is either the one that initiated the charging or that the user is in the same group and thus allowed to terminate the charging. Once authorized, the Charging Station informs the CSMS that the charging has been stopped.

. To improve the experience for users, a Charging Station MAY support local authorization of identifiers, using an <<authorization_cache,Authorization Cache>>.
. The <<local_authorize_offline,`LocalAuthorizeOffline`>> Configuration Variable controls whether a Charging Station will authorize a user when _offline_ using the Authorization Cache.
. The <<local_pre_authorize,`LocalPreAuthorize`>> Configuration Variable controls whether a Charging Station will use the Authorization Cache to start a transaction without performing an authorization with the CSMS.

=== ID Tokens

_This section is normative_

OCPP now makes it possible to use many different types of authorization. Where OCPP 1.x only supported RFID, OCPP now also supports things like: credit card, PIN-code, a simple start button etc.

An <<id_token_type,IDTokenType>> contains the identifier to use for authorization. It is defined as a combination of a case insensitive string and a type. Message data elements of the <<id_token_type,IDTokenType>> class (including GroupId) MAY contain any data, that is meaningful to a CSMS (e.g. for the purpose of identifying the initiator of charging activity), and Charging Stations MUST NOT make any presumptions as to the format or content of such data, other than is provided in the description of the IdTokenType (e.g. by assuming that it is a UID- like value that must be hex characters only and/or an even number of digits). IdToken data acquired via local token reader hardware is usually a (4, 7 or 10 bytes) UID value of a physical IdToken, typically represented as 8, 14 or 20 hexadecimal digit characters.

[cols="^.^1,10",%autowidth.stretch]
|===
s|NOTE |To promote interoperability, based on common practice to date in the case of <<id_token_type,IdTokenType>> data has type: <<id_token_enum_type,_ISO14443_>>, it is RECOMMENDED that such UIDs be represented as hex representations of the UID bytes. According to ISO 14443-3, byte 0 should come first in the hex string. (Most significant nibble of byte 0 first)
|===

==== Additional Info

AdditionalInfo can be used to send extra information which can be validated by the CSMS in addition to the regular authorization with _IdToken_.

_AdditionalInfo_ contains one or more custom types, which need to be agreed upon by all parties involved. When AdditionalInfo is implemented the Charging Station SHALL also cache and include _AdditionalInfo_ during regular operations and set the Configuration Variable <<additional_info_items_permessage,`AdditionalInfoItemsPerMessage`>>. When _AdditionalInfo_ is NOT implemented or a not supported _AdditionalInfo.type_ is used, the CSMS/Charging Station MAY ignore the _AdditionalInfo_.

[[group_id_tokens]]
=== Group ID Tokens

_This section is normative_

A CSMS has the ability to treat a set of identity tokens as a "group", thereby allowing any one token in the group to start a transaction and for the same token, or another token in the same group, to stop the transaction. This supports the common use- cases of families or businesses with multiple drivers using one or more shared electric vehicles on a single recharging contract account. <<id_token_type,IdTokenTypes>> used as "GroupId" may often use a shared central account identifier for the GroupId, instead of a UID of the first/master RFID card of an account.

Tokens (idTags) are grouped for authorization purposes by specifying a common group identifier in the optional _groupIdToken_ element in <<id_token_info_type,IdTokenInfo>>: two IdTokens are considered to be in the same group if their GroupIdTokens match (and they are not empty).

[cols="^.^1,10",%autowidth.stretch]
|===
s|NOTE 
  |Even though the GroupId has the same nominal data type (<<id_token_type,IdTokenType>>) as an idToken, the value of this element may not be in the common format of <<id_token_type,IdTokenTypes>> and/or may not represent an actual valid <<id_token_type,IdTokenType>> (e.g. it may be a common shared "account number"): therefore, the GroupId value SHOULD NOT be used for comparison against a presented Token value (unless it also occurs as an idToken value).
|===

[[authorization_cache]]
=== Authorization Cache

A Charging Station MAY implement an Authorization Cache that **autonomously** maintains a record of previously presented identifiers that have been successfully authorized by the CSMS. The Authorization Cache can be used to speed up the authorization process at the Charging Station, since using a locally stored cache means that the user does not have to wait for the Charging Station to check the authorization at the CSMS. Operation of the Authorization Cache, when present, is reported (and controlled, where possible) by the <<auth_cache_enabled,`AuthCacheEnabled`>> Configuration Variable. The optional expiration time of general Authorization Cache entries can be set in the Configuration Variable <<auth_cache_lifetime,`AuthCacheLifeTime`>>. If a different expiration time is desired for a specific entry, this can be set in the cacheExpiryDateTime that is returned in iDTokenInfo of, for example, the <<authorize_response,AuthorizeResponse>>.

Please refer to the use cases <<store_authorization_data_in_the_authorization_cache,C10 - Store Authorization Data in the Authorization Cache>> and <<start_transaction_cached_id,C12 - Start Transaction - Cached Id>> for more information on how to implement / use the Authorization Cache functionality.

When a Charging Station supports both the Authorization Cache and Tariff information (see: <<tariff_cost_related,Tariff & Cost>>), it should not store the tariff information in the Authorization Cache, since this information could become outdated. +
A Charging Station MAY support the authorization of _any_ presented identifier when _offline_ , to avoid refusal of charging to bona fide users that cannot be explicitly authorized by <<authorization_cache,Authorization Cache>> entries. This functionality is explained in more detail in <<unknown_offline_authorization,Unknown Offline Authorization>>. +
It is RECOMMENDED to store personal information in the Authorization Cache securely, e.g. by only storing hashed idTokens in the cache.

[[local_authorization_list]]
=== Local Authorization List

The Local Authorization List is a list of identifiers that can be synchronized with the CSMS. It allows authorization of a user when offline and faster (apparent) authorization response time when communication between Charging Station and CSMS is slow. The CSMS can synchronize the list by either sending a complete list of identifiers to replace the Local Authorization List or by sending a list of changes (add, update, delete) to apply to the Local Authorization List. The operations to support this are <<get_local_list_version,GetLocalListVersion>> and <<send_local_list,SendLocalList>>.

This list contains the authorization status of all (or a selection of) identifiers and the corresponding expiration date in _cacheExpiryDateTime_. These values may be used to provide more fine grained information to users (e.g. by display message) during local authorization.

Please refer to the use cases <<send_local_authorization_list,D01 - Send Local Authorization List>>, <<offline_authorization_through_local_authorization_list,C13 - Offline Authorization through Local Authorization List>> and <<online_authorization_through_local_authorization_list,C14 - Online Authorization through Local Authorization List>> for more information on how to implement / use the Local Authorization List functionality.

[cols="^.^1,10",%autowidth.stretch]
|===
s|NOTE|Please note the difference between the <<authorization_cache,Authorization Cache>> and <<local_authorization_list,Local Authorization List>> mechanisms: the <<authorization_cache,Authorization Cache>> is an autonomous mechanism at the Charging Station, whereas the <<local_authorization_list,Local Authorization List>> is a list that is synchronized between CSMS and Charging Station (originating from the CSMS).
|===

[cols="^.^1,10",%autowidth.stretch]
|===
s|NOTE|The <<authorization_cache,Authorization Cache>> and <<local_authorization_list,Local Authorization List>> are *distinct* logical data structures. When both <<authorization_cache,Authorization Cache>> as well as <<local_authorization_list,Local Authorization List>> are supported, a Charging Station SHALL treat <<local_authorization_list,Local Authorization List>> entries as having priority over <<authorization_cache,Authorization Cache>> entries for the same identifiers.
|===

The following Configuration Variables are used by the Charging Station to give information about the Local Authorization List

- <<local_auth_list_entries,`LocalAuthListEntries`>> (Also reports the maximum amount of IdTokens in the Local Authorization List)
- <<local_auth_list_enabled,`LocalAuthListEnabled`>>
- <<local_auth_list_available,`LocalAuthListAvailable`>>
- <<items_per_message_send_local_list,`ItemsPerMessageSendLocalList`>>
- <<bytes_per_message_send_local_list,`BytesPerMessageSendLocalList`>>

[[unknown_offline_authorization]]
=== Unknown Offline Authorization

When _offline_, a Charging Station MAY allow automatic authorization of any "unknown" identifiers that are not found in the <<local_authorization_list,Local Authorization List>> and/or <<authorization_cache,Authorization Cache>>. Operation of the Unknown Offline Authorization capability, when supported, is reported (and controlled, where possible) by the <<offline_tx_for_unknown_id_enabled,`OfflineTxForUnknownIdEnabled`>> Configuration Variable. When connection to the CSMS is restored, the Charging Station has to send the queued <<transaction_event_request,TransactionEventRequest>> messages. These may contain transactions that were authorized _offline_ , as explained in <<delivering_transaction_related_messages,transaction-related message handling>>. Please refer to <<offline_authorization_of_unknown_id,C15 - Unknown Offline Authorization>> for the options that the Charging Station has to continue / stop the transaction in this situation.

A Payment System may consist of multiple components handling the authorization of the user. The interface of these components and the communication between the Payment System and CSMS are not in scope of this document.

Stopping a transaction started with a credit/debit card is not defined, this is left to the implementer, this could for example be: Unplugging the cable on the EV side and/or a stop button etc.

The scenario description and sequence diagram above are based on the Configuration Variable for start transaction being configured as follows: +
<<tx_start_point,`TxStartPoint`>>: <<tx_start_stop_point_values,EVConnected, Authorized, DataSigned, PowerPathClosed, EnergyTransfer>> +
This use-case is also valid for other configurations, but then the transaction might start/stop at another moment, which might change the sequence in which message are send. For more details see the use case: <<start_transaction_options,E01 - Start Transaction options>>.

|8   |Remarks           |IdTokens MAY be (single use) virtual transaction authorization codes or virtual RFID tokens that deliberately use a non-standard UID format to avoid possible conflict with real UID values. These virtual single use <<id_token,type,IdTokens>> are sent with <<id_token_enum_type,type>> _Central_ and it is pointless to either cache or
authorize these tokens.

This use case uses an App as example, but this is not a requirement. This use case is valid for any <<request_start_transaction_request,RequestStartTransactionRequest>> with a server generated IdToken.

The scenario description and sequence diagram above are based on the Configuration Variable for start transaction being configured as follows: +
<<tx_start_point,`TxStartPoint`>>: <<tx_start_stop_point_values,EVConnected, Authorized, DataSigned, PowerPathClosed, EnergyTransfer>> +
This use-case is also valid for other configurations, but then the transaction might start/stop at another moment, which might change the sequence in which message are send. For more details see the use case: <<start_transaction_options,E01 - Start Transaction options>>.

This use case assumes that the configuration variable AuthorizeRemoteStart is false. See use cases F01 and F02 for requirements with AuthorizeRemoteStart.

Other <<id_token_enum_type,idTokenTypes>> can also be used to remote start charging, such an eMAID of the user that is provided by the app.
