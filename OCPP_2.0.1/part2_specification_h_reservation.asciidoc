== Introduction

This Functional Block describes the reservation functionality of OCPP. The reservation functionality enables an EV Driver to make a reservation of a Charging Station/EVSE, ensuring an available Connector at a Charging Station when he arrives.

With Charging Stations not being abundantly available, and EVs having limited range, EV Drivers plan their trips from Charging Station to Charging Station. They need to know for sure they can use a Charging Station they plan to go to. They don’t like it when another EV Driver has started using the Charging Station in the time they were traveling to the Charging Station.

For the EV Driver it is useful to be able to reserve a specific Type of Connector, or, when the EV Driver has no preference, an unspecified EVSE at a Charging Station. So he knows for sure he can charge at the Charging Station when he arrives.
