== Security Events

The table below provides a list of security events. Security events that are implemented SHALL be stored at the security log and security events that are implemented and marked as critical SHALL also be pushed to the CSMS. +
This is a non-exhaustive list of security events, when a security event matches the _description_ of one of the Security Events in this section, for interoperability reasons, the Security Event from this section SHALL be used, instead of adding a new (proprietary) Security Event. Some security events like; _InvalidCsmsCertificate_, _InvalidChargingStationCertificate_, etc. are mandatory to be implemented. Please refer to Part 2 - Specification for which security events are mandatory to be implemented.

The Charging Station SHALL go back to the original state, probably: 'Available'. +
    "Starting" might be the swiping of the RFID, pressing a start button, a RequestStartTransactionRequest being received etc.

|TxStartPoint |MemberList |Defines when the Charging Station starts a new transaction: first transactioneventRequest: eventType = Started. +
    When any event in the given list occurs, the Charging Station SHALL start a transaction The Charging Station SHALL only send the Started event once for every transaction. +
    It is advised to put all events that should be part of a transaction in the list, in case the start event never occurs. Because the possible events don’t always have to come in the same order it is possible to provide a list of events. Which ever comes first will then cause a transaction to be started. +
    For example: EVConnected, Authorized would mean that a transaction is started when an EV is detected (Cable is connected), or when an EV Driver swipes his RFID card en the CSMS successfully authorizes the ID for charging.
|TxStopPoint |MemberList |Defines when the Charging Station ends a transaction: last transactioneventRequest: eventType = Ended. +
    When any event in the given list is no longer valid, the Charging Station SHALL end the transaction. The Charging Station SHALL only send the Ended event once for every transaction.
|MaxEnergyOnInvalidId |integer |Maximum amount of energy in Wh delivered when an identifier is deauthorized by the CSMS after start of a transaction.
|StopTxOnInvalidId |boolean |Whether the Charging Station will stop an ongoing transaction when it receives a non- Accepted authorization status in TransactionEventResponse for this transaction.
|StopTxOnEVSideDisconnect |boolean |When set to true, the Charging Station SHALL administratively stop the transaction when the cable is unplugged from the EV.

== Reason Codes

The table below provides a list of standardized reason codes that can be used in the optional StatusInfo element of a response.

For each reason code, some messages that might typically return them are shown. This is not an exhaustive list and only indicative.

StatusInfo is optional. Any implementation should be able to function properly without StatusInfo, because every message has the response code values that are essential to perform the function. The _reasonCode_ and _additionalInfo_ in StatusInfo are meant to provide more insight on what is happening and maybe allow for some automatic recovery.

|IMPORTANT |The existence of a reason code in this table does not imply a requirement to use it nor does it imply arequirement to any of the mentioned messages.
