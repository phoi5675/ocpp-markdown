== OCPP Security

This Functional Block describes the security requirements for the OCPP protocol. The security part was developed to strengthen and mature the future development and standardization of OCPP. It is based amongst others on the end-to-end security design by LaQuSo <<ocpp_security_21,[21]>>. Security requirements are included on security measures at Charging Station and CSMS, to support users of the
OCPP.

=== Security Objectives

_This section is informative._

OCPP security has been designed to meet the following security objectives:

. To allow the creation of a secure communication channel between the CSMS and Charging Station. The integrity and confidentiality of messages on this channel should be protected with strong cryptographic measures.
. To provide mutual authentication between the Charging Station and the CSMS. Both parties should be able to identify who they are communicating with.
. To provide a secure firmware update process by allowing the Charging Station to check the source and the integrity of firmware images, and by allowing non-repudiation of these images.
. To allow logging of security events to facilitate monitoring the security of the smart charging system. A list of security related events and their 'criticality' is provided in the appendices.

=== Design Considerations

_This section is informative._

The security Functional Block was designed to fit into the approach taken in OCPP. Standard web technologies are used whenever possible to allow cost-effective implementations using available web libraries and software. No application layer security measures are included. Based on these considerations, OCPP security is based on TLS and public key cryptography using X.509 certificates. Because the CSMS usually acts as the server, different users or role-based access control on the Charging Station are not implemented in this standard. To mitigate this, it is recommended to implement access control on the CSMS. To make sure the mechanisms implemented there cannot be bypassed, OCPP should not be used by qualified personnel performing maintenance to Charging Stations locally at the Charging Station, as other protocols may be used for local maintenance purposes.

=== Security Profiles

This section defines the different OCPP security profiles and their requirement. OCPP 2.0.1 supports three security profiles:The table below shows which security measures are used by which profile.

|3. TLS with Client Side Certificates |TLS authentication using certificate

|===

- The <<unsecured_transport_with_basic_authentication_profile_1,Unsecured Transport with Basic Authentication Profile>> does not include authentication for the CSMS, or measures to set up a secure communication channel. Therefore, it should only be used in trusted networks, for instance in networks where there is a VPN between the CSMS and the Charging Station. For field operation it is highly recommended to use a security profile with TLS.
- In some cases (e.g. lab installations, test setups, etc.) one might prefer to use OCPP 2.0.1 without implementing security. While this is possible, it is NOT considered a valid OCPP 2.0.1 implementation.
- When the Charging Station does not have the correct date and time set, it cannot validate the server certificate. A solution for this might be to either use NTP, mobile network to set time automatically, or have an installer tool that sets the time before the first connection.

|A00.FR.005 |{nbsp}             |Lowering the security profile that is used, to a less secure profile, is for security reasons, not part of the OCPP specification, and MUST be done through another method, not via OCPP. OCPP messages SHALL NOT be used for this (e.g. <<set_variables_request,SetVariablesRequest>> or <<data_transfer_request,DataTransferRequest>>).
|A00.FR.006 |When a CSMS communicates with Charging Stations with different security profiles or different versions of OCPP.
  |The CSMS MAY operate the Charging Stations via different addresses or ports of the CSMS. +
  For instance, the CSMS server may have one TCP port for TLS with Basic Authentication, and another port for TLS with Client Side Certificates. +
  In this case there is only one security profile in use per port of the CSMS, which is allowed.

=== Keys used in OCPP

_This section is normative._

OCPP uses a number of public private key pairs for its security, see below Table. To manage the keys on the Charging Station, messages have been added to OCPP. Updating keys on the CSMS or at the manufacturer is out of scope for OCPP. If TLS with Client Side certificates is used, the Charging Station requires a "Charging Station certificate" for authentication against the CSMS.

|A00.FR.507 |{nbsp}               |The certificates SHALL be stored and transmitted in the X.509 format encoded in Privacy-Enhanced Mail (PEM) format.
|A00.FR.508 |{nbsp}               |All certificates SHALL include a serial number.
|A00.FR.509 |{nbsp}               |The subject field of the certificate SHALL contain the organization name of the certificate owner in the O (`organizationName`) RDN.
|A00.FR.510 |{nbsp}               |For the CSMS certificate, the subject field SHALL contain the FQDN of the endpoint of the server in the CN (`commonName`) RDN.
|A00.FR.511 |{nbsp}               |For the Charging Station certificate, the subject field SHALL contain a CN (`commonName`) RDN which consists of the unique serial number of the Charging Station. This serial number SHALL NOT be in the format of a URL or an IP address so that Charging Station certificates can be differentiated from CSMS certificates.

  {nbsp}

  Note: According to <<rfc2818,RFC 2818>>, if a subjectAltName extension of type `dnsName` is present, that must be used as the identity. This would be incompliant with OCPP and <<iso15118_1,ISO 15118>>. Therefore it SHOULD NOT be used in Charging Station and CSMS certificates. +
  It is allowed to use the subjectAltName extension of type dnsName for a CSMS, when the CSMS has multiple network paths to reach it (for example, via a private APN + VPN using its IP address in the VPN and via public Internet using a named URL).
|A00.FR.512 |{nbsp}                |For all certificates the X.509 Key Usage extension <<ocpp_security_19,[19]>> SHOULD be used to restrict the usage of the certificate to the operations for which it will be used.
|A00.FR.513 |{nbsp}                |If the Charging Station Certificate is also used as SECC Certificate in the ISO 15118 protocol, the certificate SHOULD also meet the requirements in <<iso15118_2,ISO15118-2>>.
|A00.FR.514 |{nbsp}                |For all certificates it is strongly RECOMMENDED NOT to use the X.509 Extended Key Usage extension, to be compatible with the ISO 15118 standard. There are alternative mechanisms available.

[[certificate_hierarchy]]
==== Certificate Hierarchy

_This section is normative._

The OCPP protocol supports the use of two separate certificate hierarchies:

. The Charging Station Operator hierarchy which contains the CSMS, and Charging Station certificates.
. The Manufacturer hierarchy which contains the Firmware Signing certificate.

The CSMS can update the CSO root certificates stored on the Charging Station using the <<install_certificate_request,InstallCertificateRequest>> message.

.Certificate Hierarchy requirements
[cols="^.^1,<.^2,<.^5",%autowidth.stretch,options="header",frame=all,grid=all]
|===
|ID         |Precondition         |Requirement definition

|A00.FR.601 |{nbsp}               |The Charging Station Operator MAY act as a certificate authority for the Charging Station Operator hierarchy
|A00.FR.602 |A00.FR.601           |The Charging Station Operator MAY for instance follow the certificate hierarchy described in Appendices E and F of <<iso15118_2,ISO15118-2>> and use the CSO Sub-CA 2 certificate to sign the CSMS and Charging Station certificates. This could give the advantage that the online verification of Charging Station client side certificates can be done within the Charging Station Operator’s networks, simplifying the network architecture.
|A00.FR.603 |{nbsp}               |The private keys belonging to the CSO root certificates MUST be well protected.
|A00.FR.604 |{nbsp}               |As the Manufacturer is usually a separate organization from the Charging Station Operator, a trusted third party SHOULD be used as a certificate authority. This is essential to have non-repudiation of firmware images.
|===

=== Certificate Revocation

_This section is normative._

In some cases a certificate may become invalid prior to the expiration of the validity period. Such cases include changes of the organization name, or the compromise or suspected compromise of the certificate’s private key. In such cases, the certificate needs to be revoked or indicate it is no longer valid. The revocation of the certificate does not mean that the connection needs to be closed as the the connection can stay open longer than 24 hours.

Different methods are recommended for certificate revocation, see below Table.

.Recommended revocation methods for the different certificates.

[cols="^.^1,<.^2,<.^5",%autowidth.stretch,options="header",frame=all,grid=all]
|===
|ID         |Precondition         |Requirement definition

|A00.FR.701 |{nbsp}               |Fast expiration SHOULD be used to revoke the CSMS certificate. (See Note 1)
|A00.FR.702 |{nbsp}               |The CSMS SHOULD use online certificate verification to verify the validity of the Charging Station certificates.
|A00.FR.703 |{nbsp}               |It is RECOMMENDED that a separate certificate authority server is used to manage the certificates.
|A00.FR.704 |A00.FR.703           |This server SHOULD also keep track of which certificates have been revoked.
|A00.FR.705 |{nbsp}               |The CSMS SHALL verify the validity of the certificate with the certificate authority server. (See Note 2)
|A00.FR.707 |{nbsp}               |Prior to providing the certificate for firmware validation to the Charging Station, the CSMS SHOULD validate both, the certificate and the signed firmware update.
|===

Note 1: With fast expiration, the certificate is only valid for a short period, less than 24 hours. After that the server needs to request a new certificate from the Certificate Authority, which may be the CSO itself (see section <<certificate_hierarchy,Certificate Hierarchy>>). This prevents the Charging Stations from needing to implement revocation lists or online certificate verification. This simplifies the implementation of certificate management at the Charging Station and reduces communication costs at the Charging Station side. By requiring fast expiration, if the certificate is compromised, the impact is reduced to only a short period.

When the certificate chain should becomes compromised, attackers could used forged certificates to trick a Charging Station to connect to a "fake" CSMS. By using fast expiration, the time a Charging Station is vulnerable is greatly reduced.

The Charging Station always communicates with the Certificate Authority through the CSMS, this way, if the Charging Station is compromised, the Charging Station cannot attack the CA directly.

Note 2: This allows for immediate revocation of Charging Station certificates. Revocation of Charging Station certificates will happen for instance when a Charging Station is removed. This is more common than revoking the CSMS certificate, which is normally only done when it is compromised.

[[installation]]
==== Installation

_This section is normative._

Unique credentials should be used to authenticate each Charging Station to the CSMS, whether they are the password used for HTTP Basic Authentication (see <<unsecured_transport_with_basic_authentication_profile_1,Charging Station Authentication>>) or the Charging Station certificate. These unique credentials have to be put on the Charging Station at some point during manufacturing or installation.

  |The manufacturer MAY sign these using their own certificate.
|A00.FR.805 |A00.FR.804           |It is RECOMMENDED that the CSO immediately updates the credentials after installation using the methods described in Section <<update_charging_station_password_for_http_basic_authentication,A01 - Update Charging Station Password for HTTP Basic Authentication>> or <<update_charging_station_certificate_by_request_of_csms,A02 - Update Charging Station Certificate by request of CSMS>>.
|A00.FR.806 |Before the 'factory credentials' have been updated
  |The CSMS MAY restrict the functionality that the Charging Station can use. The CSMS can use the BootNotification state: Pending for this. During the Pending state, the CSMS can update the credentials.
|A00.FR.807 |A00.FR.804 AND +
  Charging Station manufacturer certificate has expired
    |The CSMS MAY accept a connection by Charging Station in a `Pending` state after the BootNotification and immediately execute use case <<update_charging_station_certificate_by_request_of_csms,A02 - Update Charging Station Certificate by request of CSMS>> to install a new valid CSO certificate.

|7     |Error handling   |The CSMS accepts the CSR request from the Charging Station, before forwarding it to the CA. But when the CA cannot be reached, or rejects the CSR, the Charging Station will never known. The CSMS may do some checks on the CSR, but cannot do all the checks that a CA does, and it does not prevent connection timeout to the CA. When something like this goes wrong, either the CA is offline or the CSR send by the Charging Station is not correct, according to the CA. In both cases this is something an operator at the CSO needs to be notified of. The operator then needs to investigate the issue. When resolved, the operator can re-run A02. +
It is NOT RECOMMENDED to let the Charging Station retry when the certificate is not send within X minutes or hours. When the CSR is incorrect, that will not be resolved automatically. It is possible that only a new firmware will fix this.
