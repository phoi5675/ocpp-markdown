== Introduction

This Functional Block provides tariff and cost information to an EV Driver, when a Charging Station is capable of showing this on a display.

Before a driver starts charging he needs to be given tariff information, given detailed prices for all the components that make up the tariff plan applicable to this driver at this Charging Station. As this is a human readable text message, it can also be used for other things, like a personal welcome message.

Some business cases might require the EV Driver to be shown the running total cost during charging, updated at a regular, fitting interval. When the EV Driver stops charging, he needs to be shown to the total cost of the just stopped transaction.

All tariffs and costs are in the currency configured in the Configuration Variable <<currency,Currency>>.

=== Why no structured tariff information?

Because tariff structures can become very complex it will be difficult to convert these to human-readable text in the Charging Station. The CSO is the owner of the tariffs and should be able to provide the Charging Station with a human-readable tariff text. If the CSO is not able to generate human-readable texts from its own tariffs, how can a Charging Station be expected to be able to this. That is why we have kept the complexity of tariffs out of OCPP.

  |The tariff information presented this way might be equal to any token presented.

  If known, and applicable, it is advisable to show the tariff information in a language understood by the EV Driver.

  It is advisable to give the driver the option to cancel the transaction when he does not agree with the tariff. This could be not plugging in the cable, or a cancel button in the user interface etc. As long at it is clear to the driver how a transaction can be canceled.

  |If the Charging Station was offline when the transaction ended and the <<transaction_event_response,TransactionEventResponse>> with _totalCost_ is received when the Charging Station comes back online some time after that, then there is no use in displaying the cost, because the user has likely left already. A similar situation applies when `TxStopPoint` is defined as <<tx_start_stop_point_values,ParkingBayOccupancy>>, in which case the EV must leave the Charging Station to cause the transaction to end.

  The scenario description and sequence diagram above are based on the Configuration Variable for stop transaction being configured as follows. +
  <<tx_stop_point,`TxStopPoint`>>: <<tx_start_stop_point_values,ParkingBayOccupancy, EVConnected, Authorized>> +
  This use-case is also valid for other configurations, but then the transaction might stop at another moment, which might change the sequence in which message are send. For more details see the use case: <<e06_stop_transaction_options,E06 - Stop Transaction options>>
