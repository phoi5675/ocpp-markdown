== Introduction

This Functional Block describes the OCPP Transaction related functionalities. Transactions are started/stopped on the Charging Station. Note that at most one transaction can be active on an EVSE at any point in time.

[[flexible_transaction_start_stop]]
=== Flexible transaction start/stop

To support as many business cases as possible, and to prevent sending too many messages when not needed for certain business cases, OCPP 2.0.1 supports flexible configuration of the start and stop of a transaction.

For this the following Configuration Variables are defined:

- <<tx_start_point,`TxStartPoint`>>
- <<tx_stop_point,`TxStopPoint`>>

These 2 Configuration Variables make it possible to define when a transaction should start: <<transaction_event_request,TransactionEventRequest>> (eventType = Started) and when a transaction should stop: <<transaction_event_request,TransactionEventRequest>> (eventType = Ended)

With the introduction in OCPP 2.0.1 of flexible start/stop points of a transaction, it is important to provide a definition of a transaction.

****
A transaction is the portion of a charging session that is recorded by CSMS. It is a single time frame with a start and stop time. This information can be used by the operator for billing.
****

It is up to the Charging Station Operator to define the values for TxStartPoint and TxStopPoint (unless these are preset as read-only values in the charging station), but not all combinations make sense.

The following three variants are most common:

- If connection time is billed, then start and stop points should be `EVConnected`.
- If time of use is billed, then the start points should be `EVConnected`, Authorized and the stop point `EVConnected`. +
(Such that upon authorization first, the charger is already seen as 'in use').
- If charging time is billed, then start and stop points should be `PowerPathClosed`. (This starts as soon as charger is ready to provide power and stops when authorization is revoked or vehicle disconnected.) Pauses in between (i.e. SuspendedEV(SE)) do not end the transaction. Billing on the amount of energy or power can be done based on the meter values that are collected during the transaction.

|===
s|WARNING
  |Certain combinations of start and stop points can lead to a situation where a started transaction is never stopped. For example: when the start point is `ParkingBayOccupancy` and the stop point is `EVConnected`, then a transaction starts when an EV occupies the parking bay, but when the user never connects the EV, but simply drives away, then the transaction will remain open, because `ParkingBayOccupancy` is not configured as a stop point.
|===

==== Readonly or Read/Write

OCPP 2.0.1 supports 2 options for the transaction start/stop Configuration Variables. They can either be: RW (read-write) or R (read-only).

When a Charging Station supports RW, the CSO can configure the settings. To support all possible settings, the software in the Charging Station has to be more flexible.

With only R, the settings are fixed in firmware, the CSO can read the settings to learn how a Charging Station will behave, but cannot configure it. This makes for a simpler implementation. When the needs of the target market are well known there might be no need o implement the flexible model.

==== OCPP 1.6 Transaction compatibility

If transactions similar to OCPP 1.6 are wanted, this section describes how the transaction start and stop point should be configured.

In OCPP 1.x the moment a Charging Station should send StartTransaction.req was not defined very precise, generally this was done when the Charging Station was ready to deliver energy: cable is connected and user is authorized.

To support similar transaction start behaviour, the value: _PowerPathClosed_ is to be used. (and for completeness, also add: _EnergyTransfer_

|===
|Configuration Variable             |Values

|<<tx_start_point,`TxStartPoint`>>  |PowerPathClosed
|<<tx_stop_point,`TxStopPoint`>>    |EVConnected, Authorized
|===

For stop behavior the _ParkingBayOccupancy_ should not be added, OCPP 1.6 did not support this, and in case of a dual socket charging station where somebody is using the 'opposite' connector, the transaction would then be stopped, while the EV could still be charging.

=== TransactionId generation

New in OCPP 2.0.1: Transaction IDs are now generated by the Charging Station.

In OCPP 1.x this was done by the CSMS. This had some drawbacks. When a Charging Station was offline it had a transaction which did not have a transactionId.

The TransactionId generated by a Charging Station has to be unique for this Charging Station. During the lifetime of a Charging Station it should never use the same TransactionId twice. Also when the Charging Station is rebooted, power cycled, firmware updated, repaired etc.

OCPP does not specify an algorithm to use, but it is RECOMMENDED to use UUIDs.

[[delivering_transaction_related_messages]]
=== Delivering transaction-related messages

The primary purpose of <<transaction_event_request,TransactionEventRequest>> messages is to give the CSMS the information that it will later use to bill the transaction. To be sure that the CSMS receives all the necessary information for billing a transaction, OCPP uses two mechanisms: _retrying_ and _sequence numbers_.

==== Retrying

The Charging Station sends <<transaction_event_request,TransactionEventRequest>> messages to the CSMS System as soon as possible after the events they report on have occurred.

If the Charging Station is offline, or if an error occurs processing the message in transport, the CSMS will be missing billing information. In order to repair the missing information in the CSMS, the Charging Station should retry to deliver this information. +
When the Charging Station fails to receive a <<transaction_event_response,TransactionEventResponse>> for a <<transaction_event_request,TransactionEventRequest>> message within the <<message_timeouts,message timeout period>>, the Charging Station should follow the retry procedure described in use case <<e13_transaction_related_message_not_accepted_by_csms,E13 - Transaction-related message not accepted by CSMS>>.

==== Sequence numbers

When delivery of <<transaction_event_request,TransactionEventRequest>> messages fails and will be retried later, the result is that <<transaction_event_request,TransactionEventRequest>>
messages may arrive in the CSMS in a different order from the one in which the transaction events occurred at the Charging
Station. This in turn would make it difficult for the CSMS to know if it received all <<transaction_event_request,TransactionEventRequest>> messages about a
transaction, which the CSMS may want to know before it starts billing the transaction.

In order to make it possible to know that all <<transaction_event_request,TransactionEventRequest>> messages about a transaction were received, OCPP uses _sequence numbers_ in TransactionEventRequest messages. For every EVSE, the Charging Station maintains a counter of the number of <<transaction_event_request,TransactionEventRequest>> messages generated about that EVSE. When generating a new <<transaction_event_request,TransactionEventRequest>> message, the Charging Station includes the current value of the EVSE’s counter in the **seqNo** field of the request, and then increments the counter. With this mechanism, a CSMS can check if it has full information about a transaction by checking that:

- It received a <<transaction_event_request,TransactionEventRequest>> about the start of the transaction, with a **seqNo** _a_
- It received a <<transaction_event_request,TransactionEventRequest>> about the stop of the transaction, with a **seqNo** _o_ greater than _a_.
- It received a <<transaction_event_request,TransactionEventRequest>> about the transaction with **seqNo** _n_ for every integer _n_ between _a_ and _o_

[[sequence_number_generation]]
===== Sequence number generation

_This section is normative_.

When a transaction starts, the Charging Station SHOULD set the _seqNo_ field for the <<transaction_event_request,TransactionEventRequest>> message to 0. +
(Implementations with a continuously increasing _seqNo_ are still allowed.)

After each <<transaction_event_request,TransactionEventRequest>> Charging Station SHALL increase the _seqNo_ by 1.

=== Authorization

To simplify the use cases in this functional block, the way an EV Driver is authorized is not part of these use cases. It will simply be called something like: "User authorization successful" or "The EV Driver is authorized by the Charging Station and/or CSMS.". This may be any way of authorizing an EV Driver. See functional block: <<authorization,C Authorization>> for all the options and requirements for authorization.

=== Clarification for optional fields in TransactionEventRequest

_This section is informative._

The TransactionEventRequest contains several optional fields. Some of these fields should only be sent once and should not be repeated in every TransactionEventRequest. The following summary points to the requirements related to these optional fields.

**_evse_**

(E01.FR.16) The field _evse_ is only provided in the first TransactionEventRequest that occurs after the EV has connected. It is not repeated in all future TransactionEventRequests.

**_idToken_**

(E03.FR.01) The field _idToken_ is provided once in the first TransactionEventRequest that occurs after the transaction has been authorized. +
(E07.FR.02) The field _idToken_ is provided once in the TransactionEventRequest that occurs when the authorization of the transaction has been ended. +
(C12.FR.02) The above is also the case when authorization was granted because the idToken is present in the authorization cache with a `Accepted` status. +
(F02.FR.05): The above is also the case when the idToken is provided by a RequestStartTransactionRequest.

**_reservationId_**

(E03.FR.03/H01.FR.15) The field _reservationId_ is only provided in the first TransactionEventRequest that occurs when the transaction has been authorized by the idToken for which a reservation existed in the charging station. +
(F02.FR.06) The above is also the case when the idToken is provided by a RequestStartTransactionRequest.

**_meterValue_**

(E02.FR.09) The TransactionEventRequest(_eventType_=`Started`) must contain the meter values that have been configured in SampledDataCtrlr.TxStartedMeasurands. +
(E02.FR.10) A TransactionEventRequest(_eventType_=`Updated`) must be sent at every interval configured in SampledDataCtrlr.TxUpdatedInterval and contain the meter values that have been configured in SampledDataCtrlr.TxUpdatedMeasurands. If TxUpdatedMeasurands == 0, then no meter values are sent. +
(E06.FR.11) The TransactionEventRequest(_eventType_=`Ended`) must contain the meter values that have been configured in SampledDataCtrlr.TxEndedMeasurands. If SampledDataCtrlr.TxEndedInterval == 0, then only the values taken at start and end of the transaction are included.

**_transactionInfo.chargingState_**

(E02.FR.13) Whenever the charging state changes, the Charging Station must send a TransactionEventRequest containing _chargingState_. This implies that a TransactionEventRequest(_eventType_=`Started`) always has a _chargingState_, because the state goes from non-existent to a value. +
If the change of charging state is the only event, then TransactionEventRequest has a _triggerReason_ = `ChargingStateChanged`, but if a change in charging state occurs together with other events, such as those represented by _triggerReason_ `CablePluggedIn` or (`Stop`)`Authorized`, for example, then _chargingState_ can simply be reported as part of that message. +
A TransactionEventRequest with _triggerReason_ = `ChargingStateChanged` must contain _chargingState_.

**_transactionInfo.stoppedReason_**

(C15.FR.04, E05.FR.10, E05.FR.08/09, E07.FR.06) The _stoppedReason_ must be provided in the TransactionEventRequest(_eventType_=`Ended`), unless the value is `Local`, in which case it may be omitted. +
(F03.FR.03, F03.FR.10, F04.FR.03) The above also applies to transactions that are stopped by a RequestStopTransactionRequest, however in this case the _stoppedReason_ value must be `Remote`.

**_transactionInfo.remoteStartId_**

(C05.FR.03, F01.FR.25, F02.FR.01) The _remoteStartId_ must be sent in the next TransactionEventRequest after the RequestStartTransactionRequest with the same _remoteStartId_.

  |The scenario description and sequence diagram above are based on the Configuration Variable for start & stop transaction being configured as follows: +
  <<tx_start_point,`TxStartPoint`>>: <<tx_start_stop_point_values,Authorized, DataSigned, PowerPathClosed, EnergyTransfer>> +
  <<tx_stop_point,`TxStopPoint`>>: <<tx_start_stop_point_values,ParkingBayOccupancy, EVConnected>> +
  This use-case is also valid for other configurations, but then the transaction might start/stop at another moment, which might change the sequence in which message are sent. For more details see the use cases: <<e01_start_transaction_options,E01 - Start Transaction options>> and <<e06_stop_transaction_options,E06 - Stop Transaction options>>.

==== E13 - Transaction-related message not accepted by CSMS - Example

As an example, consider a Charging Station that has the value "3" for the <<message_attempts_transaction_event,`MessageAttemptsTransactionEvent`>> Configuration Variable and the value "60" for the <<message_attempt_interval_transaction_event,`MessageAttemptIntervalTransactionEvent`>> Configuration Variable. It sends a <<transaction_event_request,TransactionEventRequest>> message and detects a failure to process the message in the CSMS. The Charging Station SHALL wait for 60 seconds, and resend the message. In the case when there is a second failure, the Charging Station SHALL wait for 120 seconds, before resending the message. If this final attempt fails, the Charging Station SHALL discard the message and continue with the next transaction-related message, if there is any.

|1   |Name            |Check transaction status
|2   |ID              |E14
|{nbsp} d|_Functional block_ |E. Transactions
|3   |Objective(s)    |To enable the CSMS to request the status of a transaction and to find out whether there are queued transaction-related messages.
|4   |Description
  |There are scenarios where a CSMS needs to know whether there are still messages for a transaction that need to be delivered. For example: A CSMS receives a <<transaction_event_request,TransactionEventRequest>> (<<transaction_event_enum_type,eventType = Ended>>), it wants to start the billing process for this transaction but detects it is still missing some intermediate messages (it can check this via the sequence number in the messages). It can ask if the Charging Station has still messages in the queue for this transaction with the <<get_transaction_status_request,GetTransactionStatusRequest>> specifying the transactionId. Depending on the result the CSMS might for example: wait for the messages to be delivered, or start the billing process without the information. It may also need to know whether a transaction is still ongoing. If the CSMS wants to know if there are transaction-related messages in the queue at all (not just for a specific transaction), it can send a <<get_transaction_status_request,GetTransactionStatusRequest>> without a transactionId.
|{nbsp} d|_Actors_    |CSMS, Charging Station
|{nbsp} d|_Scenario description_ 
  |**1.** The CSMS sends a <<get_transaction_status_request,GetTransactionStatusRequest>> with or without a transactionId to the Charging Station. +
  **2.** The Charging Station responds with a <<get_transaction_status_response,GetTransactionStatusResponse>>.
|5   |Prerequisites   |The CSMS knows the transactionId of a transaction it wants to know the status of.
|6   |Postcondition(s) 
  |**Successful postcondition:** +
  The CSMS knows the status of the requested transaction. +
  **Failure postcondition:** +
  The CSMS does not know the status of the requested transaction.

  |When the CSMS receives a <<get_transaction_status_response,GetTransactionStatusResponse>> with both fields (_ongoingIndicator_ and _messagesInQueue_) set to false, this might mean that the transaction is finished and there are no more messages in the queue for this transaction, or the Charging Station doesn’t know anything about this transaction (anymore).
