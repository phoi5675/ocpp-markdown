== Introduction

This Functional Block describes the functionality that enables parties to extend existing commands with custom attributes or add new custom commands to OCPP

OCPP offers two mechanisms to create vendor-specific custom extension.

. The <<data_transfer_request,DataTransferRequest>> message allows for the exchange of data or messages not standardized in OCPP. As such, it offers a framework within OCPP for experimental functionality that may find its way into future OCPP versions. Experimenting can be done without creating new (possibly incompatible) OCPP dialects. Secondly, it offers a possibility to implement additional functionality agreed upon between specific CSMS and Charging Station vendors.
. A CustomData element exists as an optional element in the JSON schemas of all types. CustomData is the only class in the JSON schema files that allows additional properties. It can thus be used to add additional custom attributes to any type. The CustomData has been deliberately left out of the specification document, because it would introduce a lot of clutter and it is not meant to be used in standard implementations. See also <<ocpp2_0_part4,[OCPP2.0-PART4]>>.

The DataTransferRequest/Response contains a field without a length or type specification. It can be convenient to use this field as
structured JSON content.

_Example of embedded JSON_

```json
[2,
"<unique msg id>",
"DataTransfer",
{
  "vendorId": "com.mycompany.ice",
  "messageId": "iceParkedAtCs"
  "data": { "start_time": "2020-04-01T11:01:02" }
}
]
```

|IMPORTANT |Please use with extreme caution and only for optional functionality, since it will impact your compatibility with other systems that do not make use of this option. We recommend mentioning the usage explicitly in your documentation and/or communication. Please consider consulting the Open Charge Alliance before turning to this option to add functionality.
