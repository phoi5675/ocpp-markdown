== Scope

This document defines the protocol used between a **Charge Point** and **Central System**. If the protocol requires a certain action or response from one side or the other, then this will be stated in this document.

The specification does not define the communication technology. Any technology will do, as long as it supports TCP/IP connectivity.

<<<

== Terminology and Conventions

=== Conventions

The key words “MUST”, “MUST NOT”, “REQUIRED”, “SHALL”, “SHALL NOT”, “SHOULD”, “SHOULD NOT”, “RECOMMENDED”, “MAY”, and “OPTIONAL” in this document are to be interpreted as described in <<rfc2119,[RFC2119]>>, subject to the following additional clarification clause:

The phrase “valid reasons in particular circumstances” relating to the usage of the terms “SHOULD”, “SHOULD NOT”, “RECOMMENDED”, and “NOT RECOMMENDED” is to be taken to mean technically valid reasons, such as the absence of necessary hardware to support a function from a charge point design: for the purposes of this specification it specifically excludes decisions made on commercial, or other non-technical grounds, such as cost of implementation, or likelihood of use.

All sections and appendixes, except “Scope” and “Terminology and Conventions”, are normative, unless they are explicitly indicated to be informative.

=== Definitions

This section contains the terminology that is used throughout this document.

== Introduction

This is the specification for OCPP version 1.6.

OCPP is a standard open protocol for communication between Charge Points and a Central System and is designed to accommodate any type of charging technique.

OCPP 1.6 introduces new features to accommodate the market: Smart Charging, OCPP using JSON over Websockets, better diagnostics possibilities (<<reason,Reason>>), more Charge Point <<charge_point_status,Statuses>> and <<trigger_message,TriggerMessage>>. OCPP 1.6 is based on OCPP 1.5, with some new features and a lot of textual improvements, clarifications and fixes for all known ambiguities. Due to improvements and new features, OCPP 1.6 is not backward compatible with OCPP 1.5.

For a full list of changes, see: <<appendix_a_new_in_ocpp_1_6,New in OCPP 1.6>>.

Some basic concepts are explained in the sections below in this introductory chapter. The chapters: <<operations_initiated_by_charge_point,Operations Initiated by Charge Point>> and <<operations_initiated_by_central_system,Operations Initiated by Central System>> describe the operations supported by the protocol. The exact messages and their parameters are detailed in the chapter: <<messages,Messages>> and data types are described in chapter: <<types,Types>>. Defined configuration keys are described in the chapter: <<standard_configuration_key_names_and_values,Standard Configuration Key Names & Values>>.

=== Edition 2

This document is OCPP 1.6 edition 2. This document still describes the same protocol: OCPP 1.6, only the documentation is improved. On message level there are no changes compared to the original release of OCPP 1.6 of October 2015. All known errata (previously published in a separate document) have been merged into this document, making it easier for the implementers to work with the specification. When there is doubt about the way OCPP 1.6 should be implemented, this document over rules the original document.

=== Document structure

With the introduction of OCPP 1.6, there are two different flavours of OCPP; next to the SOAP based implementations, there is the possibility to use the much more compact JSON alternative. To avoid confusion in communication on the type of implementation we recommend using the distinct suffixes -J and -S to indicate JSON or SOAP. In generic terms this would be OCPP-J for JSON and OCPP-S for SOAP.

To support the different flavours, the OCPP standard is divided in multiple documents. The base document (the one you are reading now) contains the technical protocol specification. The technical protocol specification must be used with one of the transport protocol specifications. the <<ocpp_imp_s,OCPP SOAP Specification>> contains the implementation specification needed to make a OCPP-S implementation. For OCPP-J, the <<ocpp_imp_j,OCPP JSON>> Specification must be used.

For improved interoperabillity between the Central Systems and Charge Points, it is adviced to meet the requirements stated in the <<ocpp_1.6ct,OCPP 1.6 Compliance>> testing documentation.

[[feature_profiles]]
=== Feature Profiles

This section is normative.

In OCPP 1.6 features and associated messages are grouped in _profiles_. Depending on the required functionality, implementers can choose to implement one or more of the following profiles.

[cols="3,10",options="headers"]
|===
|PROFILE NAME |DESCRIPTION

|**Core** |Basic Charge Point functionality comparable with OCPP 1.5 <<ocpp1.5,[OCPP1.5]>> without support for firmware updates, local authorization list management and reservations.
|**Firmware Management** |Support for firmware update management and diagnostic log file download.
|**Local Auth List Management** |Features to manage the local authorization list in Charge Points.
|**Reservation** |Support for reservation of a Charge Point.
|**Smart Charging** |Support for basic Smart Charging, for instance using control pilot.
|**Remote Trigger** |Support for remote triggering of Charge Point initiated messages
|===

These profiles can be used by a customer to determine if a OCPP 1.6 product has the required functionality for their business case. Compliance testing will test per profile if a product is compliant with the OCPP 1.6 specification.

Implementation of the Core profile is required. Other profiles are optional.

When the profiles **Core** , **Firmware Management** , **Local Auth List Management** and **Reservation** are implemented, all functions originating from OCPP 1.5 <<ocpp1.5,[OCPP1.5]>> are covered.

The grouping of all messages in their profiles can be found in the table below.

The support for the specific feature profiles is reported by the <<supported_feature_profiles,`SupportedFeatureProfiles`>> configuration key.

=== General views of operation

This section is informative.

The following figures describe the general views of the operations between Charge Point and Central System for two cases:

. a Charge Point requesting authentication of a card and sending charge transaction status
. Central System requesting a Charge Point to update its firmware

The arrow labels in the following figures indicate the PDUs exchanged during the invocations of the operations. These PDUs are defined in detail in the <<messages,Messages>> section.

.Sequence Diagram: Example of starting and stopping a transaction
image::images/figure_1.svg[Figure 1. Sequence Diagram: Example of starting and stopping a transaction]

When a Charge Point needs to charge an electric vehicle, it needs to authenticate the user first before the charging can be started. If the user is authorized the Charge Point informs the Central System that it has started with charging.

When a user wishes to unplug the electric vehicle from the Charge Point, the Charge Point needs to verify that the user is either the one that initiated the charging or that the user is in the same group and thus allowed to terminate the charging. Once authorized, the Charge Point informs the Central System that the charging has been stopped.

[cols="1,10"]
|===
|[.info-icon]#i# |A Charge Point MUST NOT send an Authorize.req before stopping a transaction if the presented idTag is the same as the idTag presented to start the transaction
|===

.Sequence Diagram: Example of a firmware update
image::images/figure_2.svg[Sequence Diagram: Example of a firmware update]

When a Charge Point needs to be updated with new firmware, the Central System informs the Charge Point of the time at which the Charge Point can start downloading the new firmware. The Charge Point SHALL notify the Central System after each step as it downloads and installs the new firmware.

[[local_authorization_and_offline_behavior]]
=== Local Authorization & Offline Behavior

This section is normative.

In the event of unavailability of the communications or even of the Central System, the Charge Point is designed to operate stand-alone. In that situation, the Charge Point is said to be _offline_.

To improve the experience for users, a Charge Point MAY support local authorization of identifiers, using an <<authorization_cache,Authorization Cache>> and/or a <<local_authorization_list,Local Authorization List>>.

This allows (a) authorization of a user when _offline_ , and (b) faster (apparent) authorization response time when communication between Charge Point and Central System is slow.

The <<local_authorize_offline,`LocalAuthorizeOffline`>> configuration key controls whether a Charge Point will authorize a user when _offline_ using the Authorization Cache and/or the Local Authorization List.

The <<local_pre_authorize,`LocalPreAuthorize`>> configuration key controls whether a Charge Point will use the Authorization Cache and/or the Local Authorization List to start a transaction without waiting for an authorization response from the
Central System.

A Charge Point MAY support the (automatic) authorization of any presented identifier when _offline_ , to avoid refusal of charging to bona-fide users that cannot be explicitly authorized by Local Authorization List/Authorization Cache entries. This functionality is explained in more detail in <<unknown_offline_authorization,Unknown Offline Authorization>>.

[[authorization_cache]]
==== Authorization Cache

A Charge Point MAY implement an _Authorization Cache_ that autonomously maintains a record of previously presented identifiers that have been successfully authorized by the Central System. ( _Successfully_ meaning: a response received on a message containing an idTag)

If implemented, the Authorization Cache SHOULD conform to the following semantics:

* The Cache contains all the latest received identifiers (i.e. valid and NOT-valid).
* The Cache is updated using all received <<id_tag_info,IdTagInfo>> (from <<authorize_conf,Authorize.conf>>, <<start_transaction_conf,StartTransaction.conf>> and <<stop_transaction_conf,StopTransaction.conf>>)
* When the validity of a Cache entry expires, it SHALL be changed to expired in the Cache.
* When an <<id_tag_info,IdTagInfo>> is received for an identifier in the Cache, it SHALL be updated.
* If new identifier authorization data is received and the Authorization Cache is full, the Charge Point SHALL remove any NOT-valid entries, and then, if necessary, the oldest valid entries to make space for the new entry.
* Cache values SHOULD be stored in non-volatile memory, and SHOULD be persisted across reboots and power outages.
* When an identifier is presented that is stored in the cache as NOT-valid, and the Charge Point is _online_ : an <<authorize_req,Authorize.req>> SHOULD be sent to the central System to check the current state of the identifier.

Operation of the Authorization Cache, when present, is reported (and controlled, where possible) by the <<authorization_cache_enabled,`AuthorizationCacheEnabled`>> configuration key.

[[local_authorization_list]]
==== Local Authorization List

The Local Authorization List is a list of identifiers that can be synchronized with the Central System.

The list contains the authorization status of all (or a selection of) identifiers and the authorization status/expiration date.

Identifiers in the Local Authorization list can be marked as **valid** , **expired** , **(temporarily) blocked** , or **blacklisted** , corresponding to <<id_tag_info,IdTagInfo>> _status_ values _Accepted_ / _ConcurrentTx_ , _Expired_ , _Blocked_ , and _Invalid_, respectively.

These values may be used to provide more fine grained information to users (e.g. by display message) during local authorization.

The Local Authorization List SHOULD be maintained by the Charge Point in non-volatile memory, and SHOULD be persisted across reboots and power outages.

A Charge Point that supports Local Authorization List SHOULD implement the configuration key: <<local_auth_list_max_length,LocalAuthListMaxLength>> This gives the Central System a way to known the the maximum possible number of Local Authorization List elements in a Charge Point

The Charge Point indicates whether the Local Authorization List is supported by the presence or absence of the `LocalAuthListManagement` element in the value of the <<supported_feature_profiles,`SupportedFeatureProfiles`>> configuration key.

Whether the Local Authorization List is enabled is reported and controlled by the <<local_auth_list_enabled,LocalAuthListEnabled>> configuration key.

The Central System can synchronize this list by either (1) sending a complete list of identifiers to replace the Local Authorization List or (2) by sending a list of changes (add, update, delete) to apply to the Local Authorization List. The operations to support this are <<get_local_list_version_by_central_system,Get Local List Version>> and <<send_local_list_by_central_system,Send Local List>>.

.Sequence Diagram: Example of a differential local authorization list update
image::images/figure_4.svg[Sequence Diagram: Example of a differential local authorization list update]

The Charge Point SHALL NOT modify the contents of the Authorization List by any other means than upon a the receipt of a SendLocalList PDU from the Central System.

[cols="1,10"]
|===
|[.info-icon]#i# |Conflicts between the local authorization list and the validity reported in, for instance, a <<start_transaction_conf,StartTransaction.conf>> message might occur. When this happens the Charge Point SHALL inform the Central System by sending a <<status_notification,StatusNotification>> with ConnectorId set to 0, and ErrorCode set to 'LocalListConflict'.
|===

==== Relation between Authorization Cache and Local Authorization List

The Authorization Cache and Local Authorization List are distinct logical data structures. Identifiers known in the Local Authorization List SHALL NOT be added to the Authorization Cache.

Where both Authorization Cache and Local Authorization List are supported, a Charge Point SHALL treat Local Authorization List entries as having priority over Authorization Cache entries for the same identifiers.

[[unknown_offline_authorization]]
==== Unknown Offline Authorization

When _offline_, a Charge Point MAY allow automatic authorization of any "unknown" identifiers that cannot be explicitly authorized by Local Authorization List or Authorization Cache entries. Identifiers that are present in a Local Authorization List that have a status other than “Accepted” (Invalid, Blocked, Expired) MUST be rejected. +
Identifiers that were valid but are apparently expired due to passage of time MUST also be rejected

Operation of the Unknown Offline Authorization capability, when supported, is reported (and controlled, where possible) by the <<allow_offline_tx_for_unknown_id,`AllowOfflineTxForUnknownId`>> configuration key.

When connection to the Central Server is restored, the Charge Point SHALL send a <<start_transaction_by_charge_point,Start Transaction>> request for any transaction that was authorized offline , as required by <<transaction_related_messages,transaction-related message handling>>. When the authorization status in the <<start_transaction_conf,StartTransaction.conf>> is not _Accepted_, and the transaction is still ongoing, the Charge Point SHOULD:

* when <<stop_transaction_on_invalid_id,`StopTransactionOnInvalidId`>> is set to _true_: stop the transaction normally as stated in <<stop_transaction_by_central_system,Stop Transaction>>. The Reason field in the Stop Transaction request should be set to DeAuthorized. If the Charge Point has the possibility to lock the Charging Cable, it SHOULD keep the Charging Cable locked until the owner presents his identifier.
* when <<stop_transaction_on_invalid_id,StopTransactionOnInvalidId>> is set to _false_: only stop energy delivery to the vehicle.

[cols="1,10"]
|===
|[.info-icon]#i# |In the case of an invalid identifier, an operator MAY choose to charge the EV with a minimum amount of energy so the EV is able to drive away. This amount is controlled by the optional configuration key: <<max_energy_on_invalid_id,MaxEnergyOnInvalidId>>.
|===

=== Transaction in relation to Energy Transfer Period

This section is informative.

The <<energy_transfer_period,Energy Transfer Period>> is a period of time during wich energy is transferred between the EV and the EVSE. +
There MAY be multiple Energy Transfer Periods during a <<transaction,Transaction>>

Multiple Energy Transfer Periods can be separated by either:
* an EVSE-initiated supense of transfer during which de EVSE does not offer energy transfer
* an EV-initiated suspense of transfer during which the EV remains electrically connected to the EVSE
* an EV-initiated suspense of transfer during which the EV is not electrically connected to the EVSE.

A Central System MAY deduce the start and end of an Energy Transfer Period from: the MeterValues that are sent during the Transaction, the status notifications: Charging, SuspendedEV and/or SuspendedEVSE. etc. +
Central System implementations need to take into account factors such as: Some EVs don't go to state SuspendedEV: they might continue to trickle charge. Some Charge Point don't even have a electrical meter.

.OCPP Charging Session and transaction definition
image::images/figure_5.svg[OCPP Charging Session and transaction definition]

[[transaction_related_messages]]
=== Transaction-related messages

This section is normative.

The Charge Point SHOULD deliver transaction-related messages to the Central System in chronological order as soon as possible. Transaction-related messages are <<start_transaction_req,StartTransaction.req>>, <<stop_transaction_req,StopTransaction.req>> and periodic or clock-aligned <<metervalues_req,MeterValues.req>> messages.

When _offline_ , the Charge Point MUST queue any transaction-related messages that it would have sent to the Central System if the Charge Point had been online.

In the event that a Charge Point has transaction-related messages queued to be sent to the Central System, new messages that are not transaction-related MAY be delivered immediately without waiting for the queue to be emptied. It is therefore allowed to send, for example, an Authorize request or a Notifications request before the transaction-related message queue has been emptied, so that customers are not kept waiting and urgent notifications are not delayed.

The delivery of new transaction-related messages SHALL wait until the queue has been emptied. This is to ensure that transaction-related messages are always delivered in chronological order.

When the Central System receives a transaction-related message that was queued on the Charge Point for some time, the Central System will not be aware that this is a historical message, other than by inference given that the various timestamps are significantly in the past. It SHOULD process such a message as any other.

[[error_responses_to_transaction_related_messages]]
==== Error responses to transaction-related messages

It is permissible for the Charge Point to skip a transaction-related message if and only if the Central System repeatedly reports a 'failure to process the message'. Such a stipulation is necessary, because otherwise the requirement to deliver every transaction-related message in chronological order would entail that the Charge Point cannot deliver any transaction-related messages to the Central System after a software bug causes the Central System not to acknowledge one of the Charge Point's transaction-related messages.

What kind of response, or failure to respond, constitutes a 'failure to process the message' is defined in the documents <<ocpp_imp_j,OCPP JSON Specification>> and <<ocpp_imp_s,OCPP SOAP Specification>>.

The number of times and the interval with which the Charge Point should retry such failed transaction-related messages MAY be configured using the <<transaction_message_attempts,TransactionMessageAttempts>> and <<transaction_message_retry_interval,TransactionMessageRetryInterval>> configuration keys.

When the Charge Point encounters a first failure to deliver a certain transaction-related message, it SHOULD send this message again as long as it keeps resulting in a failure to process the message and it has not yet encountered as many failures to process the message for this message as specified in its <<transaction_message_attempts,TransactionMessageAttempts>> configuration key. Before every retransmission, it SHOULD wait as many seconds as specified in its <<transaction_message_retry_interval,TransactionMessageRetryInterval>> key, multiplied by the number of preceding transmissions of this same message.

As an example, consider a Charge Point that has the value "3" for the <<transaction_message_attempts,TransactionMessageAttempts>> configuration key and the value "60" for the <<transaction_message_retry_interval,TransactionMessageRetryInterval>> configuration key. It sends a StopTransaction message and detects a failure to process the message in the Central System. The Charge Point SHALL wait for 60 seconds, and resend the message. In the case when there is a second failure, the Charge Point SHALL wait for 120 seconds, before resending the message. If this final attempt fails, the Charge Point SHOULD discard the message and continue with the next transaction-related message, if there is any.

=== Connector numbering

This section is normative.

To enable Central System to be able to address all the connectors of a Charge Point, ConnectorIds MUST always be numbered in the same way.

Connectors numbering (ConnectorIds) MUST be as follows:

* ID of the first connector MUST be 1
* Additional connectors MUST be sequentially numbered (no numbers may be skipped)
* ConnectorIds MUST never be higher than the total number of connectors of a Charge Point
* For operations intiated by the Central System, ConnectorId 0 is reserved for addressing the entire Charge Point.
* For operations initiated by the Charge Point (when reporting), ConnectorId 0 is reserved for the Charge Point main controller.

Example: A Charge Point with 3 connectors: All connectors MUST be numbered with the IDs: 1, 2 and 3. It is advisable to number the connectors of a Charge Point in a logical way: from left to right, top to bottom incrementing.

=== ID Tokens

This section is normative.

In most cases, <<idtoken,IdToken>> data acquired via local token reader hardware is usually a (4 or 7 byte) UID value of a physical RFID card, typically represented as 8/14 hexadecimal digit characters.

However, <<idtoken,IdTokens>> sent to Charge Points by Central Systems for remotely initiated charging sessions may commonly be (single use) virtual transaction authorization codes, or virtual RFID tokens that deliberately use a non-standard UID format to avoid possible conflict with real UID values.

Also, <<idtoken,IdToken>> data used as <<parent_idtag,ParentIds>> may often use a shared central account identifier for the ParentId, instead of a UID of the first/master RFID card of an account.

Therefore, message data elements of the <<idtoken,IdToken>> class (including ParentId) MAY contain any data, subject to the constraints of the data-type (CiString20Type), that is meaningful to a Central System (e.g. for the purpose of identifying the initiator of charging activity), and Charge Points MUST NOT make any presumptions as to the format or content of such data (e.g. by assuming that it is a UID-like value that must be hex characters only and/or an even number of digits).

[cols="1,10"]
|===
|[.info-icon]#i# |
To promote interoperability, based on common practice to date in the case of <<idtoken,IdToken>> data representing physical ISO 14443 compatible RFID card UIDs, it is RECOMMENDED that such UIDs be represented as hex representations of the UID bytes. According to ISO14443-3, byte 0 should come first in the hex string.
|===

[[parent_idtag]]
=== Parent idTag

This section is normative.

A Central System has the ability to treat a set of identity tokens as a “group”, thereby allowing any one token in the group to start a transaction and for the same token, or another token in the same group, to stop the transaction. This supports the common use-cases of families or businesses with multiple drivers using one or more shared electric vehicles on a single recharging contract account.

Tokens (idTags) are grouped for authorization purposes by specifying a common group identifier in the optional ParentId element in <<id_tag_info,IdTagInfo>>: two idTags are considered to be in the same group if their ParentId Tags match.

[cols="1,10"]
|===
|[.info-icon]#i# |
Even though the ParentId has the same nominal data type (<<idtoken,IdToken>>) as an idTag, the value of this element may not be in the common format of <<idtoken,IdTokens>> and/or may not represent an actual valid <<idtoken,IdToken>> (e.g. it may be a common shared "account number"): therefore, the ParentId value SHOULD NOT be used for comparison against a presented Token value (unless it also occurs as an idTag value).
|===

[[reservations]]
=== Reservations

This section is informative.

Reservation of a Charge Point is possible using the <<reserve_now_by_central_system,Reserve Now>> operation. This operation reserves the Charge Point until a certain expiry time for a specific idTag. A parent idTag may be included in the reservation to support 'group' reservations. It is possible to reserve a specific connector on a Charge Point or to reserve any connector on a Charge Point. A reservation is released when the reserved idTag is used on the reserved connector (when specified) or on any connector (when unspecified) or when the expiry time is reached or when the reservation is explicitly canceled.

[[vendor_specific_data_transfer]]
=== Vendor-specific data transfer

This section is informative.

The mechanism of vendor-specific data transfer allows for the exchange of data or messages not standardized in OCPP. As such, it offers a framework within OCPP for experimental functionality that may find its way into future OCPP versions. Experimenting can be done without creating new (possibly incompatible) OCPP dialects Secondly, it offers a possibility to implement additional functionality agreed upon between specific Central System and Charge Point vendors.

The operation Vendor Specific Data MAY be initiated either by the Central System or by the Charge Point.

[cols="1,10"]
|===
|[.warning-icon]#!# |
Please use with extreme caution and only for optional functionality, since it will impact your compatibility with other systems that do not make use of this option. We recommend mentioning the usage explicitly in your documentation and/or communication. Please consider consulting the Open Charge Alliance before turning to this option to add functionality.
|===

=== Smart Charging

This section is normative.

With Smart Charging a Central System gains the ability to influence the charging power or current of a specific EV, or the total allowed energy consumption on an entire Charge Point / a group of Charge Points, for instance based on a grid connection, energy availability on the gird or the wiring of a building. Influencing the charge power or current is based on energy transfer limits at specific points in time. Those limits are combined in a Charging Profile.

[[charging_profile_purposes]]
==== Charging profile purposes

A charging profile consists of a charging schedule, which is basically a list of time intervals with their maximum charge power or current, and some values to specify the time period and recurrence of the schedule.

There are three different types of charging profiles, depending on their purpose:

[[charge_point_max_profile]]
* _ChargePointMaxProfile_

In load balancing scenarios, the Charge Point has one or more local charging profiles that limit the power or current to be shared by all connectors of the Charge Point. The Central System SHALL configure such a profile with ChargingProfilePurpose set to _"ChargePointMaxProfile"_. _ChargePointMaxProfile_ can only be set at Charge Point ConnectorId 0.

[[tx_default_profile]]
* _TxDefaultProfile_

Default schedules for new transactions MAY be used to impose charging policies. An example could be a policy that prevents charging during the day. For schedules of this purpose, ChargingProfilePurpose SHALL be set to _TxDefaultProfile_.

_If TxDefaultProfile is set to ConnectorId 0, the TxDefaultProfile is applicable to all Connectors._

_If ConnectorId is set >0, it only applies to that specific connector._

_In the event a TxDefaultProfile for connector 0 is installed, and the Central System sends a new profile with ConnectorId >0, the TxDefaultProfile SHALL be replaced only for that specific connector._


* [[tx_profile]]_TxProfile_

If a transaction-specific profile with purpose _TxProfile_ is present, it SHALL overrule the default charging profile with purpose <<tx_default_profile,TxDefaultProfile>> for the duration of the current transaction only. After the transaction is stopped the profile SHOULD be deleted. If there is no transaction active on the connector specified in a charging profile of type _TxProfile_, then the Charge Point SHALL discard it and return an error status in <<set_charging_profile_conf,SetChargingProfile.conf>>.

The final schedule constraints that apply to a transaction are determined by merging the profiles with purposes _ChargePointMaxProfile_ with the profile _TxProfile_ or the <<tx_default_profile,TxDefaultProfile>> in case no profile of purpose _TxProfile_ is provided. _TxProfile SHALL only be set at Charge Point ConnectorId >0_.

==== Stacking charging profiles

It is allowed to stack charging profiles of the same charging profile purpose in order to describe complex calendars. For example, one can define a charging profile of purpose <<tx_default_profile,TxDefaultProfile>> with a duration and recurrence of one week that allows full power or current charging on weekdays from 23:00h to 06:00h and from 00:00h to 24:00h in weekends and reduced power or current charging at other times. On top of that, one can define other <<tx_default_profile,TxDefaultProfiles>> that define exception to this rule, for example for holidays.

Precedence of charging profiles is determined by the value of their StackLevel parameter. At any point in time the prevailing charging profile SHALL be the charging profile with the highest stackLevel among the profiles that are valid at that point in time, as determined by their validFrom and validTo parameters.

To avoid conflicts, the existence of multiple Charging Profiles with the same <<stack_level,stackLevel>> and Purposes in a Charge Point is not allowed. Whenever a Charge Point receives a Charging Profile with a stackLevel and Purpose that already exists in the Charge Point, the Charge Point SHALL replace the existing profile.

[cols="1,10"]
|===
|[.info-icon]#i# |
In the case an updated charging profile (with the same stackLevel and purpose) is sent with a validFrom dateTime in the future, the Charge Point SHALL replace the installed profile and SHALL revert to default behavior until validFrom is reached. It is RECOMMENDED to provide a start time in the past to prevent gaps.
|===

[cols="1,10"]
|===
|[.info-icon]#i# |
If you use Stacking without a duration, on the highest stack level, the Charge Point will never fall back to a lower stack level profile.
|===

[[combining_charging_profile_purposes]]
==== Combining charging profile purposes

The Composite Schedule that will guide the charging level is a combination of the prevailing Charging Profiles of the different <<charging_profile_purposes,chargingProfilePurposes>>.

This Composite Schedule is calculated by taking the minimum value for each time interval. Note that time intervals do not have to be of fixed length, nor do they have to be the same for every charging profile purpose. +
This means that a resulting Composite Schedule MAY contain intervals of different lengths.

At any point in time, the available power or current in the Composite Schedule, which is the result of merging the schedules of charging profiles <<charge_point_max_profile,ChargePointMaxProfile>> and <<tx_default_profile,TxDefaultProfile>> (or <<tx_profile,TxProfile>>), SHALL be less than or equal to lowest value of available power or current in any of the merged schedules.

In the case the Charge Point is equipped with more than one Connector, the limit value of ChargePointMaxProfile is the limit for all connectors combined. The combined energy flow of all connectors SHALL NOT be greater then the limit set by ChargePointMaxProfile.

==== Smart Charging Use Cases

This section is informative.

There may be many different uses for smart charging. The following three typical kinds of smart charging will be used to illustrate the possible behavior of smart charging:

* <<load_balancing,Load balancing>>
* <<central_smart_charging,Central smart charging>>
* <<local_smart_charging,Local smart charging>>

There are more complex use cases possible in which two or more of the above use cases are combined into one more complex system.

[[load_balancing]]
[discrete]
==== Load Balancing

This section is informative.

The Load Balancing use case is about internal load balancing within the Charge Point, the Charge Point controls the charging schedule per connector. The Charge Point is configured with a fixed limit, for example the maximum current of the connection to the grid.

The optional charging schedule field <<minchargingrate,minChargingRate>> may be used by the Charge Point to optimize the power distribution between the connectors. The parameter informs the Charge Point that charging below <<minchargingrate,minChargingRate>> is inefficient, giving the possibility to select another balancing strategy.

.Load balancing Smart Charging topology
image::images/figure_6.svg[Load balancing Smart Charging topology]

[[central_smart_charging]]
[discrete]
==== Central Smart Charging

This section is informative.

With Central smart charging the constraints on the charging schedule, per transaction, are determined by the Central System. The Central System uses these schedules to stay within limits imposed by any external system.

The Central System directly controls the limits on the connectors of the Charge Points.

.Central Smart Charging topology
image::images/figure_7.svg[Central Smart Charging topology]

Central smart charging assumes that charge limits are controlled by the Central System. The Central System receives a capacity forecast from the grid operator (DSO) or another source in one form or another and calculates charging schedules for some or all charging transactions, details of which are out of scope of this specification.

The Central System imposes charging limits on connectors. In response to a <<start_transaction_req,StartTransaction.req>> PDU The Central System may choose to set charging limits to the transaction using the TxProfile.

Central Smart Charging can be done with a Control Pilot signal, albeit with some limitations, because an EV cannot communicate its charging via the Control Pilot signal. In analogy to the <<local_smart_charging,Local Smart Charging>> use case, a connector can execute a charging schedule by the Control Pilot signal. This is illustrated in the Figure below:

.Sequence Diagram: Central Smart Charging
image::images/figure_8.svg[Sequence Diagram: Central Smart Charging]

Explanation for the above figure:

* After authorization the connector will set a maximum current to use via the Control Pilot signal. This limit is based on a (default) charging profile that the connector had previously received from the Central System. The EV starts charging and a <<start_transaction_req,StartTransaction.req>> is sent to the Central System.
* While charging is in progress the connector will continuously adapt the maximum current or power according to the charging profile. Optionally, at any point in time the Central System may send a new charging profile for the connector that shall be used as a limit schedule for the EV.

[[local_smart_charging]]
[discrete]
==== Local Smart Charging

The Local Smart Charging use case describes a use case in which smart charging enabled Charge Points have charging limits controlled locally by a Local Controller, not the Central System. The use case for local smart charging is about limiting the amount of power that can be used by a group of Charge Points, to a certain maximum. A typical use would be a number of Charge Points in a parking garage where the rating of the connection to the grid is less than the sum the ratings of the Charge Points. Another application might be that the Local Controller receives information about the availability of power from a DSO or a local smart grid node.

.Local Smart Charging topology
image::images/figure_9.svg[Local Smart Charging topology]

Local smart charging assumes the existence of a Local Controller to control a group of Charge Points. The Local Controller is a logical component. It may be implemented either as a separate physical component or as part of a 'master' Charge Point controlling a number of other Charge Points. The Local Control implements the OCPP protocol and is a proxy for the group members' OCPP messages, and may or may not have any connectors of its own.

In the case of local smart charging the Local Controller imposes charging limits on a Charge Point. These limits may be changed dynamically during the charging process in order to keep the power consumption of the group of Charge Points within the group limits. The group limits may be pre-configured in the Local Controller or may have been configured by the Central System.

The optional charging schedule field <<minchargingrate,minChargingRate>> may be used by the Local Controller to optimize the power distribution between the connectors. The parameter informs the Local Controller that charging below <<minchargingrate,minChargingRate>> is inefficient, giving the possibility to select another balancing strategy.

The following diagram illustrates the sequence of messages to set charging limits on Charge Points in a Local Smart Charging group. These limits can either be pre-configured in the Local Controller in one way or another, or they can be set by the Central System. The Local Controller contains the logic to distribute this capacity among the connected connectors by adjusting their limits as needed.

.Presetting Local Group Limits
image::images/figure_10.svg[Presetting Local Group Limits]

The next diagram describe the sequence of messages for a typical case of Local Smart Charging. For simplicity's sake, this case only involves one connector.

.Sequence Diagram: Local Smart Charging
image::images/figure_11.svg[Sequence Diagram: Local Smart Charging]

Explanation for the above figure:

* After authorization the connector will set a maximum current to use, via the Control Pilot signal. This limit is based on a (default) charging profile that the connector had previously received from the Local Controller. The EV starts charging and sends a <<start_transaction_req,StartTransaction.req>>.
* The <<start_transaction_req,StartTransaction.req>> is sent to the Central System via the Local Controller, so that also the Local Controller knows a transaction has started. The Local Controller just passes on the messages between Charge Point and Central System, so that the Central System can address all the Local Smart Charging group members individually.
* While charging is in progress the connector will continuously adapt the maximum current according to the charging profile. +
Optionally, at any point in time the Local Controller may send a new charging profile to the connector that shall be used as a limit schedule for the EV.

==== Discovery of Charge Point Capabilities

This section is normative.

The smart charging options defined can be used in extensive ways. Because of the possible limitations and differences in capabilities between Charge Points, the Central System needs to be able to discover the Charge Point specific capabilities. This is ensured by the standardized configuration keys as defined in this chapter. A Smart Charging enabled Charge Point SHALL implement, and support reporting of, the following configuration keys through the <<get_configuration_req,GetConfiguration.req>> PDU

[cols="1",options="header"]
|===
|SMART CHARGING CONFIGURATION KEYS

|<<charge_profile_max_stack_level,ChargeProfileMaxStackLevel>>

|<<max_charging_profiles_installed,MaxChargingProfilesInstalled>>
|===

A full list of all standardized configuration keys can be found in chapter <<standard_configuration_key_names_and_values,Standard Configuration Key Names & Values>>.

[[offline_behavior_of_smart_charging]]
==== Offline behavior of smart charging

This section is normative.

If a Charge Point goes _offline_ after having received a transaction-specific charging profile with purpose <<tx_profile,TxProfile>>, then it SHALL continue to use this profile for the duration of the transaction.

If a Charge Point goes _offline_ before a transaction is started or before a transaction-specific charging profile with purpose TxProfile was received, then it SHALL use the charging profiles that are available. Zero or more of the following charging profile purposes MAY have been previously received from the Central System:

* _ChargePointMaxProfile_
* _TxDefaultProfile_

See section <<combining_charging_profile_purposes,Combining Charging Profile Purposes>> for a description on how to combine charging profiles with different purposes.

If a Charge Point goes _offline_ , without having any charging profiles, then it SHALL execute a transaction as if no constraints apply.

[[example_data_structure_for_smart_charging]]

Implementations MUST use ISO 8601 date time notation. Message receivers must be able to handle fractional seconds and time zone offsets (another implementation might use them). Message senders MAY save data usage by omitting insignificant fractions of seconds.

=== Metering Data

This section is normative.

Extensive metering data relating to charging sessions can be recorded and transmitted in different ways depending on its intended purpose. There are two obvious use cases (but the use of meter values is not limited to these two):

* <<charging_session_meter_values,Charging Session Meter Values>>

* <<,Clock-Aligned Meter Values>>

Both types of meter readings MAY be reported in standalone <<metervalues_req,MeterValues.req>> messages (during a transaction) and/or as part of the transactionData element of the <<stop_transaction_req,StopTransaction.req>> PDU.

[[charging_session_meter_values]]
==== Charging Session Meter Values

Frequent (e.g. 1-5 minute interval) meter readings taken and transmitted (usually in "real time") to the Central System, to allow it to provide information updates to the EV user (who is usually not at the charge point), via web, app, SMS, etc., as to the progress of the charging session. In OCPP, this is called "sampled meter data", as the exact frequency and time of readings is not very significant, as long as it is "frequent enough". "Sampled meter data" can be configured with the following configuration keys:

* <<meter_values_sampled_data,MeterValuesSampledData>>
* <<meter_values_sampled_data_max_length,MeterValuesSampledDataMaxLength>>
* <<meter_value_sample_interval,MeterValueSampleInterval>>
* <<stop_txn_sampled_data,StopTxnSampledData>>
* <<stop_txn_sampled_data_max_length,StopTxnSampledDataMaxLength>>

<<meter_value_sample_interval,MeterValueSampleInterval>> is the time (in seconds) between sampling of metering (or other) data, intended to be transmitted by "MeterValues" PDUs. Samples are acquired and transmitted periodically at this interval from the start of the charging transaction.

A value of "0" (numeric zero), by convention, is to be interpreted to mean that no sampled data should be transmitted.

<<meter_values_sampled_data,MeterValuesSampledData>> is a comma separated list that prescribes the set of measurands to be included in a MeterValues.req PDU, every <<meter_value_sample_interval,MeterValueSampleInterval>> seconds. The maximum amount of elements in the <<meter_values_sampled_data,MeterValuesSampledData>> list can be reported by the Charge Point via: <<meter_values_sampled_data_max_length,MeterValuesSampledDataMaxLength>>

<<stop_txn_sampled_data,StopTxnSampledData>> is a comma separated list that prescribes the sampled measurands to be included in the TransactionData element of StopTransaction.req PDU, every <<meter_value_sample_interval,MeterValueSampleInterval>> seconds from the start of the Transaction. The maximum amount of elements in the <<stop_txn_sampled_data,StopTxnSampledData>> list can be reported by the Charge Point via: <<stop_txn_sampled_data_max_length,StopTxnSampledDataMaxLength>>.

[[clock_aligned_meter_values]]
==== Clock-Aligned Meter Values

Grid Operator might require meter readings to be taken from fiscally certified energy meters, at specific Clock aligned times (usually every quarter hour, or half hour).

"Clock-Aligned Billing Data" can be configured with the following configuration keys:

* <<clock_aligned_data_interval,ClockAlignedDataInterval>>
* <<meter_values_aligned_data,MeterValuesAlignedData>>
* <<meter_values_aligned_data_max_length,MeterValuesAlignedDataMaxLength>>
* <<stop_txn_aligned_data,StopTxnAlignedData>>
* <<stop_txn_aligned_data_max_length,StopTxnAlignedDataMaxLength>>

<<clock_aligned_data_interval,ClockAlignedDataInterval>> is the size of the clock-aligned data interval (in seconds). This defines the set of evenly spaced meter data aggregation intervals per day, starting at 00:00:00 (midnight).

For example, a value of 900 (15 minutes) indicates that every day should be broken into 96 15-minute intervals.

A value of "0" (numeric zero), by convention, is to be interpreted to mean that no clock-aligned data should be transmitted.

<<meter_values_aligned_data,MeterValuesAlignedData>> is a comma separated list that prescribes the set of measurands to be included in a MeterValues.req PDU, every <<clock_aligned_data_interval,ClockAlignedDataInterval>> seconds. The maximum amount of elements in the <<meter_values_aligned_data,MeterValuesAlignedData>> list can be reported by the Charge Point via:

<<meter_values_aligned_data_max_length,MeterValuesAlignedDataMaxLength>>

<<stop_txn_aligned_data,StopTxnAlignedData>> is a comma separated list that prescribes the set of clock-aligned periodic measurands to be included in the TransactionData element of StopTransaction.req PDU for every <<clock_aligned_data_interval,ClockAlignedDataInterval>> of the Transaction. The maximum amount of elements in the <<stop_txn_aligned_data,StopTxnAlignedData>> list can be reported by the Charge Point via: <<stop_txn_aligned_data_max_length,StopTxnAlignedDataMaxLength>>

[[multiple_locations_phases]]
==== Multiple Locations/Phases

When a Charge Point can measure the same measurand on multiple locations or phases, all possible locations and/or phases SHALL be reported when configured in one of the relevant configuration keys.

For example: A Charge Point capable of measuring _Current.Import_ on _Inlet_ (all 3 phases) (grid connection) and _Outlet_ (3 phases per connector on both its connectors). _Current.Import_ is set in MeterValuesSampledData. MeterValueSampleInterval is set to 300 (seconds). Then the Charge Point should send:

* a <<metervalues_req,MeterValues.req>> with: _connectorId_ = 0; with 3 _SampledValue_ elements, one per phase with _location_ = _Inlet_.
* a <<metervalues_req,MeterValues.req>> with: _connectorId_ = 1; with 3 _SampledValue_ elements, one per phase with _location_ = _Outlet_.
* a <<metervalues_req,MeterValues.req>> with: _connectorId_ = 2; with 3 _SampledValue_ elements, one per phase with _location_ = _Outlet_.

[[unsupported_measurands]]
==== Unsupported measurands
When a Central System sends a ChangeConfiguration.req to a Charge Point with one of the following configuration keys:

* <<meter_values_aligned_data,MeterValuesAlignedData>>
* <<meter_values_sampled_data,MeterValuesSampledData>>
* <<stop_txn_aligned_data,StopTxnAlignedData>>
* <<stop_txn_sampled_data,StopTxnSampledData>>

If the comma separated list contains one or more measurands that are not supported by this Charge Point, the Charge Point SHALL respond with: <<change_configuration_conf,ChangeConfiguration.conf>> with: _status_ = _Rejected_. No changes SHALL be made to the currently configuration.

[[no_metering_data_in_a_stop_transaction]]
==== No metering data in a Stop Transaction
When the configuration keys: <<stop_txn_aligned_data,StopTxnAlignedData>> and <<stop_txn_sampled_data,StopTxnSampledData>> are set to an empty string, the Charge Point SHALL not put meter values in a StopTransaction.req PDU.

[[operations_initiated_by_charge_point]]
== Operations Initiated by Charge Point

[[authorize]]
=== Authorize

.Sequence Diagram: Authorize
image::images/figure_12.svg[Sequence Diagram: Authorize]

Before the owner of an electric vehicle can start or stop charging, the Charge Point has to authorize the operation. The Charge Point SHALL only supply energy after authorization. When stopping a Transaction, the Charge Point SHALL only send an <<authorize_req,Authorize.req>> when the identifier used for stopping the transaction is different from the identifier that started the transaction.

<<authorize_req,Authorize.req>> SHOULD only be used for the authorization of an identifier for charging.

A Charge Point MAY authorize identifier locally without involving the Central System, as described in Local Authorization List. If an idTag presented by the user is not present in the <<local_authorization_list,Local Authorization List>> or Authorization Cache, then the Charge Point SHALL send an <<authorize_req,Authorize.req>> PDU to the Central System to request authorization. If the idTag is present in the Local Authorization List or Authorization Cache, then the Charge Point MAY send an Authorize.req PDU to the Central System.

Upon receipt of an <<authorize_req,Authorize.req>> PDU, the Central System SHALL respond with an <<authorize_conf,Authorize.conf>> PDU. This response PDU SHALL indicate whether or not the idTag is accepted by the Central System. If the Central System accepts the idTag then the response PDU MAY include a <<id_tag_info,**parentIdTag**>> and MUST include an authorization status value indicating acceptance or a reason for rejection.

If Charge Point has implemented an Authorization Cache, then upon receipt of an <<authorize_conf,Authorize.conf>> PDU the Charge Point SHALL update the cache entry, if the idTag is not in the <<local_authorization_list,Local Authorization List>>, with the <<id_tag_info,IdTagInfo>> value from the response as described under Authorization Cache.

[[boot_notification]]
=== Boot Notification

.Sequence Diagram: Boot Notification
image::images/figure_13.svg[Sequence Diagram: Boot Notification]

After start-up, a Charge Point SHALL send a request to the Central System with information about its configuration (e.g. version, vendor, etc.). The Central System SHALL respond to indicate whether it will accept the Charge Point.

The Charge Point SHALL send a <<boot_notification_req,BootNotification.req>> PDU each time it boots or reboots. Between the physical power-on/reboot and the successful completion of a BootNotification, where Central System returns _Accepted_ or _Pending_ , the Charge Point SHALL NOT send any other request to the Central System. This includes cached messages that are still present in the Charge Point from before.

When the Central System responds with a <<boot_notification_conf,BootNotification.conf>> with a status _Accepted_ , the Charge Point will adjust the heartbeat interval in accordance with the interval from the response PDU and it is RECOMMENDED to synchronize its internal clock with the supplied Central System's current time. If the Central System returns something other than _Accepted_ , the value of the interval field indicates the minimum wait time before sending a next BootNotification request. If that interval value is zero, the Charge Point chooses a waiting interval on its own, in a way that avoids flooding the Central System with requests. A Charge Point SHOULD NOT send a <<boot_notification_req,BootNotification.req>> earlier, unless requested to do so with a <<trigger_message_req,TriggerMessage.req>>.

If the Central System returns the status _Rejected_ , the Charge Point SHALL NOT send any OCPP message to the Central System until the aforementioned retry interval has expired. During this interval the Charge Point may no longer be reachable from the Central System. It MAY for instance close its communication channel or shut down its communication hardware. Also the Central System MAY close the communication channel, for instance to free up system resources. While _Rejected_ , the Charge Point SHALL NOT respond to any Central System initiated message. the Central System SHOULD NOT initiate any.

The Central System MAY also return a _Pending_ registration status to indicate that it wants to retrieve or set certain information on the Charge Point before the Central System will accept the Charge Point. If the Central System returns the _Pending_ status, the communication channel SHOULD NOT be closed by either the Charge Point or the Central System. The Central System MAY send request messages to retrieve information from the Charge Point or change its configuration. The Charge Point SHOULD respond to these messages. The Charge Point SHALL NOT send request messages to the Central System unless it has been instructed by the Central System to do so with a <<trigger_message_req,TriggerMessage.req>> request.

While in _pending_ state, the following Central System initiated messages are not allowed: <<remote_start_transaction_req,RemoteStartTransaction.req>> and <<remote_stop_transaction_req,RemoteStopTransaction.req>>

==== Transactions before being accepted by a Central System

A Charge Point Operator MAY choose to configure a Charge Point to accept transactions before the Charge Point is accepted by a Central System. Parties who want to implement this such behavior should realize that it is uncertain if those transactions can ever be delivered to the Central System.

After a restart (for instance due to a remote reset command, power outage, firmware update, software error etc.) the Charge Point MUST again contact the Central System and SHALL send a BootNotification request. If the Charge Point fails to receive a BootNotification.conf from the Central System, and has no in-built non-volatile real-time clock hardware that has been correctly preset, the Charge Point may not have a valid date / time setting, making it impossible to later determine the date / time of transactions.

It might also be the case (e.g. due to configuration error) that the Central System indicates a status other than Accepted for an extended period of time, or indefinitely.

It is usually advisable to deny all charging services at a Charge Point if the Charge Point has never before been Accepted by the Central System (using the current connection settings, URL, etc.) since users cannot be authenticated and running transactions could conflict with provisioning processes.

[[data_transfer_by_chargepoint]]
=== Data Transfer

.Sequence Diagram: Data Transfer
image::images/figure_14.svg[Sequence Diagram: Data Transfer]

If a Charge Point needs to send information to the Central System for a function not supported by OCPP, it SHALL use the <<data_transfer_req,DataTransfer.req>> PDU.

The vendorId in the request SHOULD be known to the Central System and uniquely identify the vendor-specific implementation. The VendorId SHOULD be a value from the reversed DNS namespace, where the top tiers of the name, when reversed, should correspond to the publicly registered primary DNS name of the Vendor organisation.

Optionally, the messageId in the request PDU MAY be used to indicate a specific message or implementation.

The length of data in both the request and response PDU is undefined and should be agreed upon by all parties involved.

If the recipient of the request has no implementation for the specific vendorId it SHALL return a status 'UnknownVendor' and the data element SHALL not be present. In case of a messageId mismatch (if used) the recipient SHALL return status 'UnknownMessageId'. In all other cases the usage of status 'Accepted' or 'Rejected' and the data element is part of the vendor-specific agreement between the parties involved.

[[diagnostics_status_notification_by_charge_point]]
=== Diagnostics Status Notification

.Sequence Diagram: Diagnostics Status Notification
image::images/figure_15.svg[Sequence Diagram: Diagnostics Status Notification]

Charge Point sends a notification to inform the Central System about the status of a diagnostics upload. The Charge Point SHALL send a <<diagnostics_status_notification_req,DiagnosticsStatusNotification.req>> PDU to inform the Central System that the upload of diagnostics is busy or has finished successfully or failed. The Charge Point SHALL only send the status Idle after receipt of a TriggerMessage for a Diagnostics Status Notification, when it is not busy uploading diagnostics.

Upon receipt of a <<diagnostics_status_notification_req,DiagnosticsStatusNotification.req>> PDU, the Central System SHALL respond with a <<diagnostics_status_notification_conf,DiagnosticsStatusNotification.conf>>.

[[firmware_status_notification_charge_point]]
=== Firmware Status Notification

.Sequence Diagram: Firmware Status Notification
image::images/figure_16.svg[Sequence Diagram: Firmware Status Notification]

A Charge Point sends notifications to inform the Central System about the progress of the firmware update. The Charge Point SHALL send a <<firmware_status_notification_req,FirmwareStatusNotification.req>> PDU for informing the Central System about the progress of the downloading and installation of a firmware update. The Charge Point SHALL only send the status Idle after receipt of a TriggerMessage for a Firmware Status Notification, when it is not busy downloading/installing firmware.

Upon receipt of a <<firmware_status_notification_req,FirmwareStatusNotification.req>> PDU, the Central System SHALL respond with a <<firmware_status_notification_conf,FirmwareStatusNotification.conf>>.

The FirmwareStatusNotification.req PDUs SHALL be sent to keep the Central System updated with the status of the update process, started by the Central System with a FirmwareUpdate.req PDU.

[[heartbeat_by_charge_point]]
=== Heartbeat

.Sequence Diagram: Heartbeat
image::images/figure_17.svg[Sequence Diagram: Heartbeat]

To let the Central System know that a Charge Point is still connected, a Charge Point sends a heartbeat after a configurable time interval.

The Charge Point SHALL send a <<heartbeat_req,Heartbeat.req>> PDU for ensuring that the Central System knows that a Charge Point is still alive.

Upon receipt of a <<heartbeat_req,Heartbeat.req>> PDU, the Central System SHALL respond with a <<heartbeat_conf,Heartbeat.conf>>. The response PDU SHALL contain the current time of the Central System, which is RECOMMENDED to be used by the Charge Point to synchronize its internal clock.

The Charge Point MAY skip sending a <<heartbeat_req,Heartbeat.req>> PDU when another PDU has been sent to the Central System within the configured heartbeat interval. This implies that a Central System SHOULD assume availability of a Charge Point whenever a PDU has been received, the same way as it would have, when it received a <<heartbeat_req,Heartbeat.req>> PDU.

[cols="1,10"]
|===
|[.info-icon]#i# |
With JSON over WebSocket, sending heartbeats is not mandatory. However, for time synchronization it is advised to at least send one heartbeat per 24 hour.
|===

[[meter_values_by_charge_point]]
=== Meter Values

.Sequence Diagram: Meter Values
image::images/figure_18.svg[Sequence Diagram: Meter Values]

A Charge Point MAY sample the electrical meter or other sensor/transducer hardware to provide extra information about its meter values. It is up to the Charge Point to decide when it will send meter values. This can be configured using the <<change_configuration_req,ChangeConfiguration.req>> message to data acquisition intervals and specify data to be acquired & reported.

The Charge Point SHALL send a <<metervalues_req,MeterValues.req>> PDU for offloading meter values. The request PDU SHALL contain for each sample:

. The id of the Connector from which samples were taken. If the connectorId is 0, it is associated with the entire Charge Point. If the connectorId is 0 and the <<measurand,Measurand>> is energy related, the sample SHOULD be taken from the main energy meter.

. The transactionId of the transaction to which these values are related, if applicable. If there is no transaction in progress or if the values are taken from the main meter, then transaction id may be omitted.

. One or more **meterValue** elements, of type <<metervalue,MeterValue>>, each representing a set of one or more data values taken at a particular point in time.

Each <<metervalue,MeterValue>> element contains a timestamp and a set of one or more individual <<sampled_value,sampledvalue>> elements, all captured at the same point in time. Each sampledValue element contains a single value datum. The nature of each sampledValue is determined by the optional <<mesurand,measurand>>, <<reading_context,context>>, <<location,location>>, <<unit_of_measure,unit>>, <<phase,phase>>, and <<value_format,format>> fields.

The optional <<measurand,measurand>> field specifies the type of value being measured/reported.

The optional <<reading_context,context>> field specifies the reason/event triggering the reading.

The optional <<location,location>> field specifies where the measurement is taken (e.g. Inlet, Outlet).

The optional <<phase,phase>> field specifies to which phase or phases of the electric installation the value applies. The Charging Point SHALL report all phase number dependent values from the electrical meter (or grid connection when absent) point of view.

[cols="1,10"]
|===
|[.info-icon]#i# |
The phase field is not applicable to all <<measurand,Measurands>>.
|===

[cols="1,10"]
|===
|[.info-icon]#i# |
Two measurands (_Current.Offered_ and _Power.Offered_) are available that are strictly speaking no measured values. They indicate the maximum amount of current/power that is being offered to the EV and are intended for use in smart charging applications.
|===

For individual connector phase rotation information, the Central System MAY query the <<connector_phase_rotation,ConnectorPhaseRotation>> configuration key on the Charging Point via <<get_configuration_by_central_system,GetConfiguration>>. The Charge Point SHALL report the phase rotation in respect to the grid connection. Possible values per connector are NotApplicable, Unknown, RST, RTS, SRT, STR, TRS and TSR. see section <<standard_configuration_key_names_and_values,Standard Configuration Key Names & Values>> for more information.

The **EXPERIMENTAL** optional <<value_format,format>> field specifies whether the data is represented in the normal (default) form as a simple numeric value ("**Raw**"), or as "**SignedData**", an opaque digitally signed binary data block, represented as hex data. This experimental field may be deprecated and subsequently removed in later versions, when a more mature solution alternative is provided.

To retain backward compatibility, the default values of all of the optional fields on a <<sampled_value,sampledValue>> element are such that a **value** without any additional fields will be interpreted, as a register reading of active import energy in Wh (Watt-hour) units.

Upon receipt of a <<metervalues_req,MeterValues.req>> PDU, the Central System SHALL respond with a <<metervalues_conf,MeterValues.conf>>.

It is likely that The Central System applies sanity checks to the data contained in a <<metervalues_req,MeterValues.req>> it received. The outcome of such sanity checks SHOULD NOT ever cause the Central System to not respond with a <<metervalues_conf,MeterValues.conf>>. Failing to respond with a <<metervalues_conf,MeterValues.conf>> will only cause the Charge Point to try the same message again as specified in <<error_responses_to_transaction_related_messages,Error responses to transaction-related messages>>.

[[start_transaction_by_charge_point]]
=== Start Transaction

.Sequence Diagram: Start Transaction
image::images/figure_19.svg[Sequence Diagram: Start Transaction]

The Charge Point SHALL send a <<start_transaction_req,StartTransaction.req>> PDU to the Central System to inform about a transaction that has been started. If this transaction ends a reservation (see <<reserve_now_by_central_system,Reserve Now>> operation), then the <<start_transaction_req,StartTransaction.req>> MUST contain the reservationId.

Upon receipt of a StartTransaction.req PDU, the Central System SHOULD respond with a <<start_transaction_conf,StartTransaction.conf>> PDU. This response PDU MUST include a transaction id and an authorization status value.

The Central System MUST verify validity of the identifier in the <<start_transaction_req,StartTransaction.req>> PDU, because the identifier might have been authorized locally by the Charge Point using outdated information. The identifier, for instance, may have been blocked since it was added to the Charge Point's <<authorization_cache,Authorization Cache>>.

If Charge Point has implemented an Authorization Cache, then upon receipt of a <<start_transaction_conf,StartTransaction.conf>> PDU the Charge Point SHALL update the cache entry, if the idTag is not in the Local Authorization List, with the <<id_tag_info,IdTagInfo>> value from the response as described under Authorization Cache.

It is likely that The Central System applies sanity checks to the data contained in a <<start_transaction_req,StartTransaction.req>> it received. The outcome of such sanity checks SHOULD NOT ever cause the Central System to not respond with a <<start_transaction_conf,StartTransaction.conf>>. Failing to respond with a <<start_transaction_conf,StartTransaction.conf>> will only cause the Charge Point to try the same message again as specified in <<error_responses_to_transaction_wrelated_messages,Error responses to transaction-related messages>>.

[[status_notification]]
=== Status Notification

.Sequence Diagram: Status Notification
image::images/figure_20.svg[Sequence Diagram: Status Notification]

A Charge Point sends a notification to the Central System to inform the Central System about a status change or an error within the Charge Point. The following table depicts changes from a previous status (left column) to a new status (upper row) upon which a Charge Point MAY send a <<status_notification_req,StatusNotification.req>> PDU to the Central System.

[cols="1,10"]

A Charge Point Connector MAY have any of the 9 statuses as shown in the table above. For ConnectorId 0, only a limited set is applicable, namely: Available, Unavailable and Faulted. The status of ConnectorId 0 has no direct connection to the status of the individual Connectors (>0).
|===

[cols="1,10"]

|[.warning-icon]#!# |
If charging is suspended both by the EV and the EVSE, status _SuspendedEVSE_ SHALL have precedence over status _SuspendedEV_.

|[.warning-icon]#!# |
When a Charge Point or a Connector is set to status Unavailable by a <<change_availability_by_central_system,Change Availability>> command, the 'Unavailable' status MUST be persistent across reboots. The Charge Point MAY use the _Unavailable_ status internally for other purposes (e.g. while updating firmware or waiting for an initial _Accepted_ <<registration_status,RegistrationStatus>>)
|===

As the status _Occupied_ has been split into five new statuses (_Preparing_, _Charging_, _SuspendedEV_, _SuspendedEVSE_ and _Finishing_), more <<status_notification_req,StatusNotification.req>> PDUs will be sent from Charge Point to the Central System. For instance, when a transaction is started, the Connector status would successively change from _Preparing_ to _Charging_ with a short _SuspendedEV_ and/or _SuspendedEVSE_ inbetween, possibly within a couple of seconds.

To limit the number of transitions, the Charge Point MAY omit sending a <<status_notification_req,StatusNotification.req>> if it was active for less time than defined in the optional configuration key <<minimum_status_duration,`MinimumStatusDuration`>>. This way, a Charge Point MAY choose not to send certain <<status_notification_req,StatusNotification.req>> PDUs.

[cols="1,10"]
|===
|[.info-icon]#i# |
A Charge Point manufacturer MAY have implemented a minimal status duration for certain status transitions separate of the <<minimum_status_duration,`MinimumStatusDuration`>> setting. The time set in <<minimum_status_duration,`MinimumStatusDuration`>> will be added to this default delay. Setting <<minimum_status_duration,`MinimumStatusDuration`>> to zero SHALL NOT override the default manufacturer's minimal status duration.
|===

[cols="1,10"]
|===
|[.warning-icon]#!# |
Setting a high <<minimum_status_duration,`MinimumStatusDuration`>> time may result in the delayed sending of all StatusNotifications, since the Charge Point will only send the <<status_notification_req,StatusNotification.req>> once the <<minimum_status_duration,`MinimumStatusDuration`>> time is passed.
|===

The Charge Point MAY send a <<status_notification_req,StatusNotification.req>> PDU to inform the Central System of fault conditions. When the 'status' field is not _Faulted_, the condition should be considered a warning since charging operations are still possible.

[cols="1,10"]

When a Charge Point is configured with <<stop_transaction_on_evside_disconnect,StopTransactionOnEVSideDisconnect>> set to _false_, a transaction is running and the EV becomes disconnected on EV side, then a <<status_notification_req,StatusNotification.req>> with the state: _SuspendedEV_ SHOULD be send to the Central System, with the 'errorCode' field set to: 'NoError'. The Charge Point SHOULD add additional information in the 'info' field, Notifying the Central System with the reason of suspension: 'EV side disconnected'. The current transaction is not stopped.

When a Charge Point is configured with <<stop_transaction_on_evside_disconnect,StopTransactionOnEVSideDisconnect>> set to _true_, a transaction is running and the EV becomes disconnected on EV side, then a <<status_notification_req,StatusNotification.req>> with the state: 'Finishing' SHOULD be send to the Central System, with the 'errorCode' field set to: 'NoError'. The Charge Point SHOULD add additional information in the 'info' field, Notifying the Central System with the reason of stopping: 'EV side disconnected'. The current transaction is stopped.

When a Charge Point connects to a Central System after having been <<local_authorization_and_offline_behavior,offline>>, it updates the Central System about its status according to the following rules:

. The Charge Point SHOULD send a <<status_notification_req,StatusNotification.req>> PDU with its current status if the status changed while the Charge Point was _offline_.
. The Charge Point MAY send a <<status_notification_req,StatusNotification.req>> PDU to report an error that occurred while the Charge Point was _offline_.
. The Charge Point SHOULD NOT send <<status_notification_req,StatusNotification.req>> PDUs for historical status change events that happened while the Charge Point was offline and that do not inform the Central System of Charge Point errors or the Charge Point's current status.
. The <<status_notification_req,StatusNotification.req>> messages MUST be sent in the order in which the events that they describe occurred.

Upon receipt of a <<status_notification_req,StatusNotification.req>> PDU, the Central System SHALL respond with a StatusNotification.conf PDU.

[[stop_transaction_by_central_system]]
=== Stop Transaction

.Sequence Diagram: Stop Transaction
image::images/figure_21.svg[Sequence Diagram: Stop Transaction]

When a transaction is stopped, the Charge Point SHALL send a <<stop_transaction_req,StopTransaction.req>> PDU, notifying to the Central System that the transaction has stopped.

A <<stop_transaction_req,StopTransaction.req>> PDU MAY contain an optional <<stop_transaction_conf,TransactionData>> element to provide more details about transaction usage. The optional <<stop_transaction_conf,TransactionData>> element is a container for any number of <<metervalue,MeterValues>>, using the same data structure as the **meterValue** elements of the <<metervalues_req,MeterValues.req>> PDU (See section <<metervalue,MeterValues>>)

Upon receipt of a <<stop_transaction_req,StopTransaction.req>> PDU, the Central System SHALL respond with a <<stop_transaction_conf,StopTransaction.conf>> PDU.

[cols="1,10"]

|[.info-icon]#i# |
<<chargepoint_errorcode,ChargePointErrorCode>> _EVCommunicationError_ SHALL only be used with status Preparing, SuspendedEV, SuspendedEVSE and Finishing and be treated as warning.
|===

The Central System cannot prevent a transaction from stopping. It MAY only inform the Charge Point it has received the <<stop_transaction_req,StopTransaction.req>> and MAY send information about the idTag used to stop the transaction. This information SHOULD be used to update the <<authorization_cache,Authorization Cache>> if implemented.

The idTag in the request PDU MAY be omitted when the Charge Point itself needs to stop the transaction. For instance, when the Charge Point is requested to reset.

If a transaction is ended in a normal way (e.g. EV-driver presented his identification to stop the transaction), the <<reason,Reason>> element MAY be omitted and the <<reason,Reason>> SHOULD be assumed 'Local'. If the transaction is not ended normally, the <<reason,Reason>> SHOULD be set to a correct value. As part of the normal transaction termination, the Charge Point SHALL unlock the cable (if not permanently attached).

The Charge Point MAY unlock the cable (if not permanently attached) when the cable is disconnected at the EV. If supported, this functionality is reported and controlled by the configuration key <<unlock_connector_on_evside_disconnect,`UnlockConnectorOnEVSideDisconnect`>>

The Charge Point MAY stop a running transaction when the cable is disconnected at the EV. If supported, this functionality is reported and controlled by the configuration key <<stop_transaction_on_evside_disconnect,`StopTransactionOnEVSideDisconnect`>>.

If <<stop_transaction_on_evside_disconnect,`StopTransactionOnEVSideDisconnect`>> is set to _false_, the transaction SHALL not be stopped when the cable is disconnected from the EV. If the EV is reconnected, energy transfer is allowed again. In this case there is no mechanism to prevent other EVs from charging and disconnecting during that same ongoing transaction. With <<unlock_connector_on_evside_disconnect,`UnlockConnectorOnEVSideDisconnect`>> set to _false_, the Connector SHALL remain locked at the Charge Point until the user presents the identifier.

By setting <<stop_transaction_on_evside_disconnect,`StopTransactionOnEVSideDisconnect`>> to _true_, the transaction SHALL be stopped when the cable is disconnected from the EV. If the EV is reconnected, energy transfer is not allowed until the transaction is stopped and a new transaction is started. If <<unlock_connector_on_evside_disconnect,`UnlockConnectorOnEVSideDisconnect`>> is set to _true_, also the Connector on the Charge Point will be unlocked.

[cols="1,10"]
|===
|[.info-icon]#i# |
If <<stop_transaction_on_evside_disconnect,`StopTransactionOnEVSideDisconnect`>> is set to _false_, this SHALL have priority over <<unlock_connector_on_evside_disconnect,`UnlockConnectorOnEVSideDisconnect`>>. In other words: cables always remain locked when the cable is disconnected at EV side when <<stop_transaction_on_evside_disconnect,`StopTransactionOnEVSideDisconnect`>> is _false_.
|===

[cols="1,10"]
|===
|[.info-icon]#i# |
Setting <<stop_transaction_on_evside_disconnect,`StopTransactionOnEVSideDisconnect`>> to _true_ will prevent sabotage acts to stop the energy flow by unplugging not locked cables on EV side.
|===

It is likely that The Central System applies sanity checks to the data contained in a <<stop_transaction_req,StopTransaction.req>> it received. The outcome of such sanity checks SHOULD NOT ever cause the Central System to not respond with a <<stop_transaction_conf,StopTransaction.conf>>. Failing to respond with a <<stop_transaction_conf,StopTransaction.conf>> will only cause the Charge Point to try the same message again as specified in <<error_responses_to_transaction_wrelated_messages,Error responses to transaction-related messages>>.

If Charge Point has implemented an Authorization Cache, then upon receipt of a <<stop_transaction_conf,StopTransaction.conf>> PDU the Charge Point SHALL update the cache entry, if the idTag is not in the <<local_authorization_list,Local Authorization List>>, with the <<id_tag_info,IdTagInfo>> value from the response as described under <<authorization_cache,Authorization Cache>>.

If the Charge Point has a reservation matching the reservationId in the request PDU, it SHALL return status 'Accepted'. Otherwise it SHALL return 'Rejected'

[[change_availability_by_central_system]]
=== Change Availability

.Sequence Diagram: Change Availability
image::images/figure_23.svg[Sequence Diagram: Change Availability]

Central System can request a Charge Point to change its availability. A Charge Point is considered available (“operative”) when it is charging or ready for charging. A Charge Point is considered unavailable when it does not allow any charging. The Central System SHALL send a <<change_availability_req,ChangeAvailability.req>> PDU for requesting a Charge Point to change its availability. The Central System can change the availability to available or unavailable.

Upon receipt of a <<change_availability_req,ChangeAvailability.req>> PDU, the Charge Point SHALL respond with a <<change_availability_conf,ChangeAvailability.conf>> PDU. The response PDU SHALL indicate whether the Charge Point is able to change to the requested availability or not. When a transaction is in progress Charge Point SHALL respond with availability status 'Scheduled' to indicate that it is scheduled to occur after the transaction has finished.

In the event that Central System requests Charge Point to change to a status it is already in, Charge Point SHALL respond with availability status 'Accepted'.

When an availability change requested with a <<change_availability_req,ChangeAvailability.req>> PDU has happened, the Charge Point SHALL inform Central System of its new availability status with a StatusNotification.req as described there.

[cols="1,10"]

[[change_configuration_by_central_system]]
=== Change Configuration

.Sequence Diagram: Change Configuration
image::images/figure_24.svg[Sequence Diagram: Change Configuration]

Central System can request a Charge Point to change configuration parameters. To achieve this, Central System SHALL send a <<change_configuration_req,ChangeConfiguration.req>>. This request contains a key-value pair, where "key" is the name of the configuration setting to change and "value" contains the new setting for the configuration setting.

Upon receipt of a <<change_configuration_req,ChangeConfiguration.req>> Charge Point SHALL reply with a <<change_configuration_conf,ChangeConfiguration.conf>> indicating whether it was able to apply the change to its configuration. Content of "key" and "value" is not prescribed. The Charge Point SHALL set the status field in the ChangeConfiguration.conf according to the following rules:

* If the change was applied successfully, and the change if effective immediately, the Charge Point SHALL respond with a status 'Accepted'.
* If the change was applied successfully, but a reboot is needed to make it effective, the Charge Point SHALL respond with status 'RebootRequired'.
* If "key" does not correspond to a configuration setting supported by Charge Point, it SHALL respond with a status 'NotSupported'.
* If the Charge Point did not set the configuration, and none of the previous statuses applies, the Charge Point SHALL respond with status 'Rejected'.

[cols="1,10"]
|===
|[.info-icon]#i# |
Examples of Change Configuration requests to which a Charge Point responds with a ChangeConfiguration.conf with a status of 'Rejected' are requests with out-of-range values and requests with values that do not conform to an expected format.
|===

If a key value is defined as a CSL, it MAY be accompanied with a `[KeyName]MaxLength` key, indicating the max length of the CSL in items. If this key is not set, a safe value of 1 (one) item SHOULD be assumed.

[[clear_cache_by_central_system]]
=== Clear Cache

.Sequence Diagram: Clear Cache
image::images/figure_25.svg[Sequence Diagram: Clear Cache]

Central System can request a Charge Point to clear its <<authorization_cache,Authorization Cache>>. The Central System SHALL send a <<clear_cache_req,ClearCache.req>> PDU for clearing the Charge Point's Authorization Cache.

Upon receipt of a <<clear_cache_req,ClearCache.req>> PDU, the Charge Point SHALL respond with a <<clear_cache_conf,ClearCache.conf>> PDU. The response PDU SHALL indicate whether the Charge Point was able to clear its Authorization Cache.

[[clear_charging_profile_by_central_system]]

If the Central System needs to send information to a Charge Point for a function not supported by OCPP, it SHALL use the <<data_transfer_req,DataTransfer.req>> PDU.

Behaviour of this operation is identical to the Data Transfer operation initiated by the Charge Point. See <<data_transfer_by_chargepoint,Data Transfer>> for details.

[[get_composite_schedule_by_central_system]]
=== Get Composite Schedule

.Sequence Diagram: Get Composite Schedule
image::images/figure_28.svg[Sequence Diagram: Get Composite Schedule]

The Central System MAY request the Charge Point to report the Composite Charging Schedule by sending a <<get_composite_schedule_req,GetCompositeSchedule.req>> PDU. The reported schedule, in the <<get_composite_schedule_conf,GetCompositeSchedule.conf>> PDU, is the result of the calculation of all active schedules and possible local limits present in the Charge Point. Local Limits might be taken into account.

Upon receipt of a <<get_composite_schedule_req,GetCompositeSchedule.req>>, the Charge Point SHALL calculate the Composite Charging Schedule intervals, from the moment the request PDU is received: Time X, up to X + Duration, and send them in the <<get_composite_schedule_conf,GetCompositeSchedule.conf>> PDU to the Central System.

If the ConnectorId in the request is set to '0', the Charge Point SHALL report the total expected power or current the Charge Point expects to consume from the grid during the requested time period.

[cols="1,10"]
|===
|[.info-icon]#i# |
Please note that the charging schedule sent by the charge point is only indicative for that point in time. this schedule might change over time due to external causes (for instance, local balancing based on grid connection capacity is active and one Connector becomes available).
|===

If the Charge Point is not able to report the requested schedule, for instance if the connectorId is unknown, it SHALL respond with a status Rejected.

[[get_configuration_by_central_system]]
=== Get Configuration

.Sequence Diagram: Get Configuration
image::images/figure_29.svg[Sequence Diagram: Get Configuration]

To retrieve the value of configuration settings, the Central System SHALL send a <<get_configuration_req,GetConfiguration.req>> PDU to the Charge Point.

If the list of keys in the request PDU is empty or missing (it is optional), the Charge Point SHALL return a list of all configuration settings in <<get_configuration_conf,GetConfiguration.conf>>. Otherwise Charge Point SHALL return a list of recognized keys and their corresponding values and read-only state. Unrecognized keys SHALL be placed in the response PDU as part of the optional unknown key list element of <<get_configuration_conf,GetConfiguration.conf>>.

The number of configuration keys requested in a single PDU MAY be limited by the Charge Point. This maximum can be retrieved by reading the configuration key <<get_configuration_max_keys,GetConfigurationMaxKeys>>.

[[get_diagnostics_by_central_system]]
=== Get Diagnostics

.Sequence Diagram: Get Diagnostics
image::images/figure_30.svg[Sequence Diagram: Get Diagnostics]

Central System can request a Charge Point for diagnostic information. The Central System SHALL send a <<get_diagnostics_req,GetDiagnostics.req>> PDU for getting diagnostic information of a Charge Point with a location where the Charge Point MUST upload its diagnostic data to and optionally a begin and end time for the requested diagnostic information.

Upon receipt of a <<get_diagnostics_req,GetDiagnostics.req>> PDU, and if diagnostics information is available then Charge Point SHALL respond with a <<get_diagnostics_conf,GetDiagnostics.conf>> PDU stating the name of the file containing the diagnostic information that will be uploaded. Charge Point SHALL upload a single file. Format of the diagnostics file is not prescribed. If no diagnostics file is available, then <<get_diagnostics_conf,GetDiagnostics.conf>> SHALL NOT contain a file name.

During uploading of a diagnostics file, the Charge Point MUST send <<diagnostics_status_notification_req,DiagnosticsStatusNotification.req>> PDUs to keep the Central System updated with the status of the upload process.

[[get_local_list_version_by_central_system]]
=== Get Local List Version

.Sequence Diagram: Get Local List Version
image::images/figure_31.svg[Sequence Diagram: Get Local List Version]

In order to support synchronisation of the <<local_authorization_list,Local Authorization List>>, Central System can request a Charge Point for the version number of the Local Authorization List. The Central System SHALL send a <<get_local_list_version_req,GetLocalListVersion.req>> PDU to request this value.

Upon receipt of a <<get_local_list_version_req,GetLocalListVersion.req>> PDU Charge Point SHALL respond with a <<get_local_list_version_conf,GetLocalListVersion.conf>> PDU containing the version number of its Local Authorization List. A version number of 0 (zero) SHALL be used to indicate that the local authorization list is empty, and a version number of -1 SHALL be used to indicate that the Charge Point does not support Local Authorization Lists.

[[remote_start_transaction_by_central_system]]
=== Remote Start Transaction

.Sequence Diagram: Remote Start Transaction
image::images/figure_32.svg[Sequence Diagram: Remote Start Transaction]

Central System can request a Charge Point to start a transaction by sending a <<remote_start_transaction_req,RemoteStartTransaction.req>>. Upon receipt, the Charge Point SHALL reply with <<remote_start_transaction_conf,RemoteStartTransaction.conf>> and a status indicating whether it has accepted the request and will attempt to start a transaction.

The effect of the RemoteStartTransaction.req message depends on the value of the <<authorize_remote_tx_requests,AuthorizeRemoteTxRequests>> configuration key in the Charge Point.

* If the value of `AuthorizeRemoteTxRequests` is _true_, the Charge Point SHALL behave as if in response to a local action at the Charge Point to start a transaction with the idTag given in the RemoteStartTransaction.req message. This means that the Charge Point will first try to authorize the idTag, using the <<local_authorization_list,Local Authorization List>>, <<authorization_cache,Authorization Cache>> and/or an <<authorize_req,Authorize.req>> request. A transaction will only be started after authorization was obtained.
* If the value of `AuthorizeRemoteTxRequests` is _false_, the Charge Point SHALL immediately try to start a transaction for the idTag given in the RemoteStartTransaction.req message. Note that after the transaction has been started, the Charge Point will send a StartTransaction request to the Central System, and the Central System will check the authorization status of the idTag when processing this StartTransaction request.

The following typical use cases are the reason for Remote Start Transaction:

* Enable a CPO operator to help an EV driver that has problems starting a transaction.
* Enable mobile apps to control charging transactions via the Central System.
* Enable the use of SMS to control charging transactions via the Central System.

The <<remote_start_transaction_req,RemoteStartTransaction.req>> SHALL contain an identifier (idTag), which Charge Point SHALL use, if it is able to start a transaction, to send a <<start_transaction_req,StartTransaction.req>> to Central System. The transaction is started in the same way as described in <<start_transaction_by_charge_point,StartTransaction>>. The <<remote_start_transaction_req,RemoteStartTransaction.req>> MAY contain a connector id if the transaction is to be started on a specific connector. When no connector id is provided, the Charge Point is in control of the connector selection. A Charge Point MAY reject a <<remote_start_transaction_req,RemoteStartTransaction.req>> without a connector id.

The Central System MAY include a <<charging_profile_type,ChargingProfile>> in the RemoteStartTransaction request. The purpose of this <<charging_profile_type,ChargingProfile>> SHALL be set to <<tx_profile,TxProfile>>. If accepted, the Charge Point SHALL use this <<charging_profile_type,ChargingProfile>> for the transaction.

[cols="1,10"]
|===
|[.info-icon]#i# |
If a Charge Point without support for Smart Charging receives a <<remote_start_transaction_req,RemoteStartTransaction.req>> with a Charging Profile, this parameter SHOULD be ignored.
|===

[[remote_stop_transaction_by_central_system]]
=== Remote Stop Transaction

.Remote Stop Transaction
image::images/figure_33.svg[Remote Stop Transaction]

Central System can request a Charge Point to stop a transaction by sending a <<remote_stop_transaction_req,RemoteStopTransaction.req>> to Charge Point with the identifier of the transaction. Charge Point SHALL reply with <<remote_stop_transaction_conf,RemoteStopTransaction.conf>> and a status indicating whether it has accepted the request and a transaction with the given transactionId is ongoing and will be stopped.

This remote request to stop a transaction is equal to a local action to stop a transaction. Therefore, the transaction SHALL be stopped, The Charge Point SHALL send a <<stop_transaction_req,StopTransaction.req>> and, if applicable, unlock the connector.

The following two main use cases are the reason for Remote Stop Transaction:

* Enable a CPO operator to help an EV driver that has problems stopping a transaction.
* Enable mobile apps to control charging transactions via the Central System.

[[reserve_now_by_central_system]]
=== Reserve Now

.Sequence Diagram: Reserve Now
image::images/figure_34.svg[Sequence Diagram: Reserve Now]

A Central System can issue a <<reserve_now_req,ReserveNow.req>> to a Charge Point to reserve a connector for use by a specific idTag.

To request a reservation the Central System SHALL send a <<reserve_now_req,ReserveNow.req>> PDU to a Charge Point. The Central System MAY specify a connector to be reserved. Upon receipt of a <<reserve_now_req,ReserveNow.req>> PDU, the Charge Point SHALL respond with a <<reserve_now_conf,ReserveNow.conf>> PDU.

If the reservationId in the request matches a reservation in the Charge Point, then the Charge Point SHALL replace that reservation with the new reservation in the request.

If the reservationId does not match any reservation in the Charge Point, then the Charge Point SHALL return the status value 'Accepted' if it succeeds in reserving a connector. The Charge Point SHALL return 'Occupied' if the Charge Point or the specified connector are occupied. The Charge Point SHALL also return 'Occupied' when the Charge Point or connector has been reserved for the same or another idTag. The Charge Point SHALL return 'Faulted' if the Charge Point or the connector are in the Faulted state. The Charge Point SHALL return 'Unavailable' if the Charge Point or connector are in the Unavailable state. The Charge Point SHALL return 'Rejected' if it is configured not to accept reservations.

If the Charge Point accepts the reservation request, then it SHALL refuse charging for all incoming idTags on the reserved connector, except when the incoming idTag or the parent idTag match the idTag or parent idTag of the reservation.

When the configuration key: <<reserve_connector_zero_supported,`ReserveConnectorZeroSupported`>> is set to _true_ the Charge Point supports reservations on connector 0. If the connectorId in the reservation request is 0, then the Charge Point SHALL NOT reserve a specific connector, but SHALL make sure that at any time during the validity of the reservation, one connector remains available for the reserved idTag. If the configuration key: <<reserve_connector_zero_supported,`ReserveConnectorZeroSupported`>> is not set or set to _false_, the Charge Point SHALL return 'Rejected'.

If the parent idTag in the reservation has a value (it is optional), then in order to determine the parent idTag that is associated with an incoming idTag, the Charge Point MAY look it up in its Local Authorization List or Authorization Cache. If it is not found in the Local Authorization List or Authorization Cache, then the Charge Point SHALL send an <<authorize_req,Authorize.req>> for the incoming idTag to the Central System. The <<authorize_conf,Authorize.conf>> response MAY contain the parent-id.

A reservation SHALL be terminated on the Charge Point when either (1) a transaction is started for the reserved idTag or parent idTag and on the reserved connector or any connector when the reserved connectorId is 0, or (2) when the time specified in expiryDate is reached, or (3) when the Charge Point or connector are set to Faulted or Unavailable.

If a transaction for the reserved idTag is started, then Charge Point SHALL send the reservationId in the <<start_transaction_req,StartTransaction.req>> PDU (see <<start_transaction_by_charge_point,Start Transaction>>) to notify the Central System that the reservation is terminated.

When a reservation expires, the Charge Point SHALL terminate the reservation and make the connector available. The Charge Point SHALL send a status notification to notify the Central System that the reserved connector is now available.

If Charge Point has implemented an Authorization Cache, then upon receipt of a <<reserve_now_conf,ReserveNow.conf>> PDU the Charge Point SHALL update the cache entry, if the idTag is not in the <<local_authorization_list,Local Authorization List>>, with the <<id_tag_info,IdTagInfo>> value from the response as described under <<authorization_cache,Authorization Cache>>.

.Sequence Diagram: Reset
image::images/figure_35.svg[Sequence Diagram: Reset]

The Central System SHALL send a <<reset_req,Reset.req>> PDU for requesting a Charge Point to reset itself. The Central System can request a hard or a soft reset. Upon receipt of a <<reset_req,Reset.req>> PDU, the Charge Point SHALL respond with a <<reset_conf,Reset.conf>> PDU. The response PDU SHALL include whether the Charge Point will attempt to reset itself.

After receipt of a Reset.req, The Charge Point SHALL send a <<stop_transaction_req,StopTransaction.req>> for any ongoing transaction before performing the reset. If the Charge Point fails to receive a <<stop_transaction_conf,StopTransaction.conf>> form the Central System, it shall queue the <<stop_transaction_req,StopTransaction.req>>

At receipt of a soft reset, the Charge Point SHALL stop ongoing transactions gracefully and send <<stop_transaction_req,StopTransaction.req>> for every ongoing transaction. It should then restart the application software (if possible otherwise restart the processor/controller).

At receipt of a hard reset the Charge Point SHALL restart (all) the hardware, it is not required to gracefully stop ongoing transaction. If possible the Charge Point sends a <<stop_transaction_req,StopTransaction.req>> for previously ongoing transactions after having restarted and having been accepted by the Central System via a <<boot_notification_conf,BootNotification.conf>>. This is a last resort solution for a not correctly functioning Charge Points, by sending a "hard" reset, (queued) information might get lost

Central System can send a <<local_authorization_list,Local Authorization List>> that a Charge Point can use for authorization of idTags. The list MAY be either a full list to replace the current list in the Charge Point or it MAY be a differential list with updates to be applied to the current list in the Charge Point.

The Central System SHALL send a <<send_local_list_req,SendLocalList.req>> PDU to send the list to a Charge Point. The <<send_local_list_req,SendLocalList.req>> PDU SHALL contain the type of update (full or differential) and the version number that the Charge Point MUST associate with the local authorization list after it has been updated.

Upon receipt of a <<send_local_list_req,SendLocalList.req>> PDU, the Charge Point SHALL respond with a <<send_local_list_conf,SendLocalList.conf>> PDU. The response PDU SHALL indicate whether the Charge Point has accepted the update of the local authorization list. If the status is Failed or VersionMismatch and the updateType was Differential, then Central System SHOULD retry sending the full local authorization list with updateType Full.

|===
|[.warning-icon]#!# |
To prevent mismatch between transactions and a TxProfile, The Central System SHALL include the transactionId in a <<set_charging_profile_req,SetChargingProfile.req>> if the profile applies to a specific transaction.
|===

These situations are described below.

==== Setting a charging profile at start of transaction

If the Central System receives a <<start_transaction_req,StartTransaction.req>> the Central System SHALL respond with a <<start_transaction_conf,StartTransaction.conf>>. If there is a need for a charging profile, The Central System MAY choose to send a <<set_charging_profile_req,SetChargingProfile.req>> to the Charge Point.

It is RECOMMENDED to check the timestamp in the <<start_transaction_req,StartTransaction.req>> PDU prior to sending a charging profile to check if the transaction is likely to be still ongoing. The <<start_transaction_req,StartTransaction.req>> might have been cached during an offline period.

==== Setting a charge profile in a RemoteStartTransaction request

The Central System MAY include a charging profile in a <<remote_start_transaction_req,RemoteStartTransaction>> request.

If the Central System includes a <<charging_profile_type,ChargingProfile>>, the ChargingProfilePurpose MUST be set to TxProfile and the transactionId SHALL NOT be set.

[cols="1,10"]
|===
|[.info-icon]#i# |
The Charge Point SHALL apply the given profile to the newly started transaction. This transaction will get a transactionId assigned by Central System via a <<start_transaction_conf,StartTransaction.conf>>. When the Charge Point receives a <<set_charging_profile_req,SetChargingProfile.req>>, with the _transactionId_ for this transaction, with the same StackLevel as the profile given in the <<remote_start_transaction_req,RemoteStartTransaction.req>>, the Charge Point SHALL replace the existing charging profile, otherwise it SHALL install/stack the profile next to the already existing profile(s).
|===

==== Setting a charging profile during a transaction

The Central System MAY send a charging profile to a Charge Point to update the charging profile for that transaction. The Central System SHALL use the <<set_charging_profile_req,SetChargingProfile.req>> PDU for that purpose. If a charging profile with the same <<charging_profile_id,chargingProfileId>>, or the same combination of <<stack_level,stackLevel>> / <<charging_profile_purpose,ChargingProfilePurpose>>, exists on the Charge Point, the new charging profile SHALL replace the existing charging profile, otherwise it SHALL be added. The Charge Point SHALL then re-evaluate its collection of charge profiles to determine which charging profile will become active. In order to ensure that the updated charging profile applies only to the current transaction, the <<charging_profile_purpose,chargingProfilePurpose>> of the <<charging_profile_type,ChargingProfile>> MUST be set to TxProfile. (See section: <<charging_profile_purpose,Charging Profile Purposes>>)

==== Setting a charging profile outside of a transaction

The Central System MAY send charging profiles to a Charge Point that are to be used as default charging profiles The Central System SHALL use the <<set_charging_profile_req,SetChargingProfile.req>> PDU for that purpose. Such charging profiles MAY be sent at any time. If a charging profile with the same <<charging_profile_id,chargingProfileId>>, or the same combination of <<stack_level,stackLevel>> / <<charging_profile_purpose,ChargingProfilePurpose>>, exists on the Charge Point, the new charging profile SHALL replace the existing charging profile, otherwise it SHALL be added. The Charge Point SHALL then re-evaluate its collection of charge profiles to determine which charging profile will become active.

|[.info-icon]#i# |
It is not possible to set a <<charging_profile_type,ChargingProfile>> with purpose set to <<tx_profile,TxProfile>> without presence of an active transaction, or in advance of a transaction.

[cols="1,10"]
|===
|[.info-icon]#i# |
When a <<charging_profile_type,ChargingProfile>> is refreshed during execution, it is advised to put the startSchedule of the new <<charging_profile_type,ChargingProfile>> in the past, so there is no period of default charging behaviour inbetween the ChargingProfiles. The Charge Point SHALL continue to execute the existing <<charging_profile_type,ChargingProfile>> until the new <<charging_profile_type,ChargingProfile>> is installed.
|===

[cols="1,10"]
|===
|[.info-icon]#i# |
If the <<charging_schedule_period,chargingSchedulePeriod>> is longer than duration , the remainder periods SHALL not be executed. If duration is longer than the <<charging_schedule_period,chargingSchedulePeriod>>, the Charge Point SHALL keep the value of the last <<charging_schedule_period,chargingSchedulePeriod>> until _duration_ has ended.
|===

[cols="1,10"]
|===
|[.info-icon]#i# |
When <<recurrency_kind_type,recurrencyKind>> is used in combination with a <<charging_schedule_period,chargingSchedulePeriod>> and/or duration that is longer then the recurrence period duration, the remainder periods SHALL not be executed.
|===

[cols="1,10"]

|[.info-icon]#i# |
When <<recurrency_kind_type,recurrencyKind>> is used in combination with a <<charging_schedule_type,chargingSchedule>> _duration_ shorter than the <<recurrency_kind_type,recurrencyKind>> period, the Charge Point SHALL fall back to default behaviour after the <<charging_schedule_type,chargingSchedule>> _duration_ ends. This fall back means that the Charge Point SHALL use a <<charging_profile_type,ChargingProfile>> with a lower stackLevel if available. If no other <<charging_profile_type,ChargingProfile>> is available, the Charge Point SHALL allow charging as if no <<charging_profile_type,ChargingProfile>> is installed. If the <<charging_schedule_period,chargingSchedulePeriod>> and/or duration is longer then the recurrence period duration, the remainder periods SHALL not be executed.

[[trigger_message]]
=== Trigger Message

.Sequence Diagram: Trigger Message
image::images/figure_38.svg[Sequence Diagram: Trigger Message]

During normal operation, the Charge Point informs the Central System of its state and any relevant occurrences. If there is nothing to report the Charge Point will send at least a heartBeat at a predefined interval. Under normal circumstances this is just fine, but what if the Central System has (whatever) reason to doubt the last known state? What can a Central System do if a firmware update is in progress and the last status notification it received about it was much longer ago than could reasonably be expected? The same can be asked for the progress of a diagnostics request. The problem in these situations is not that the information needed isn't covered by existing messages, the problem is strictly a timing issue. The Charge Point has the information, but has no way of knowing that the Central System would like an update.

The <<trigger_message_req,TriggerMessage.req>> makes it possible for the Central System, to request the Charge Point, to send Charge Point-initiated messages. In the request the Central System indicates which message it wishes to receive. For every such requested message the Central System MAY optionally indicate to which connector this request applies. The requested message is leading: if the specified connectorId is not relevant to the message, it should be ignored. In such cases the requested message should still be sent.

Inversely, if the connectorId is relevant but absent, this should be interpreted as “for all allowed connectorId values”. For example, a request for a statusNotification for connectorId 0 is a request for the status of the Charge Point. A request for a statusNotification without connectorId is a request for multiple statusNotifications: the notification for the Charge Point itself and a notification for each of its connectors.
Charge Point Central System

.Sequence Diagram: Trigger Message StatusNotification Example
image::images/figure_39.svg[Sequence Diagram: Trigger Message StatusNotification Example]

The Charge Point SHALL first send the TriggerMessage response, before sending the requested message. In the <<trigger_message_conf,TriggerMessage.conf>> the Charge Point SHALL indicate whether it will send it or not, by returning ACCEPTED or REJECTED. It is up to the Charge Point if it accepts or rejects the request to send. If the requested message is unknown or not implemented the Charge Point SHALL return NOT_IMPLEMENTED.

Messages that the Charge Point marks as accepted SHOULD be sent. The situation could occur that, between accepting the request and actually sending the requested message, that same message gets sent because of normal operations. In such cases the message just sent MAY be considered as complying with the request.

The TriggerMessage mechanism is not intended to retrieve historic data. The messages it triggers should only give current information. A <<metervalues_req,MeterValues.req>> message triggered in this way for instance SHALL return the most recent measurements for all measurands configured in configuration key <<meter_values_sampled_data,`MeterValuesSampledData`>>. <<start_transaction_req,StartTransaction>> and <<stop_transaction_req,StopTransaction>> have been left out of this mechanism because they are not state related, but by their nature describe a transition.

[[unlock_connector_by_central_system]]
=== Unlock Connector

.Sequence Diagram: Unlock Connector
image::images/figure_40.svg[Sequence Diagram: Unlock Connector]

Central System can request a Charge Point to unlock a connector. To do so, the Central System SHALL send an <<unlock_connector_req,UnlockConnector.req>> PDU.
The purpose of this message: Help EV drivers that have problems unplugging their cable from the Charge Point

in case of malfunction of the Connector cable retention. When a EV driver calls the CPO help-desk, an operator could manually trigger the sending of an <<unlock_connector_req,UnlockConnector.req>> to the Charge Point, forcing a new attempt to unlock the connector. Hopefully this time the connector unlocks and the EV driver can unplug the cable and drive away.

The <<unlock_connector_req,UnlockConnector.req>> SHOULD NOT be used to remotely stop a running transaction, use the <<remote_stop_transaction_by_central_system,Remote Stop Transaction>> instead.

Upon receipt of an <<unlock_connector_req,UnlockConnector.req>> PDU, the Charge Point SHALL respond with a <<unlock_connector_conf,UnlockConnector.conf>> PDU. The response PDU SHALL indicate whether the Charge Point was able to unlock its connector.

If there was a transaction in progress on the specific connector, then Charge Point SHALL finish the transaction first as described in <<stop_transaction_by_central_system,Stop Transaction>>.

[cols="1,10"]
|===
|[.warning-icon]#!# |
<<unlock_connector_req,UnlockConnector.req>> is intented only for unlocking the cable retention lock on the Connector not for unlocking a connector access door.
|===

[[update_firmware_by_central_system]]
=== Update Firmware

.Sequence Diagram: Update Firmware
image::images/figure_41.svg[Sequence Diagram: Update Firmware]

Central System can notify a Charge Point that it needs to update its firmware. The Central System SHALL send an <<update_firmware_req,UpdateFirmware.req>> PDU to instruct the Charge Point to install new firmware. The PDU SHALL contain a date and time after which the Charge Point is allowed to retrieve the new firmware and the location from which the firmware can be downloaded.

Upon receipt of an <<update_firmware_req,UpdateFirmware.req>> PDU, the Charge Point SHALL respond with a <<update_firmware_conf,UpdateFirmware.conf>> PDU. The Charge Point SHOULD start retrieving the firmware as soon as possible after retrieve-date.

During downloading and installation of the firmware, the Charge Point MUST send
<<firmware_status_notification_req,FirmwareStatusNotification.req>> PDUs to keep the Central System updated with the status of the update process.

The Charge Point SHALL, if the new firmware image is "valid", install the new firmware as soon as it is able to.

If it is not possible to continue charging during installation of firmware, it is RECOMMENDED to wait until Charging Session has ended (Charge Point idle) before commencing installation. It is RECOMMENDED to set connectors that are not in use to UNAVAILABLE while the Charge Point waits for the Session to end.

[cols="1,10"]
|===
|[.info-icon]#i# |
The sequence diagram above is an example. It is good practice to first reboot the Charge Point to check the new firmware is booting and able to connect to the Central System, before sending the status: _Installed_. This is not a requirement.

All "Register" values relating to a single charging transaction, or a non-transactional consumer (e.g. charge point internal power supply, overall supply) MUST be monotonically increasing in time.

The actual quantity of energy corresponding to a reported ".Register" value is computed as the register value in question minus the register value recorded/reported at the start of the transaction or other relevant starting reference point in time. For improved auditability ".Register" values SHOULD reported exactly as they are directly read from a non-volatile register in the electrical metering hardware, and SHOULD NOT be re-based to zero at the start of transactions. This allows any "missing energy" between sequential transactions, due to hardware fault, mis-wiring, fraud, etc. to be identified, by allowing the Central System to confirm that the starting register value of any transaction is identical to the finishing register value of the preceding transaction on the same connector.

== Firmware and Diagnostics File Transfer

This section is normative.

The supported transfer protocols are controlled by the configuration key _SupportedFileTransferProtocols_. FTP, FTPS, HTTP, HTTPS (CSL)

=== Download Firmware

When a Charge Point is notified about new firmware, it needs to be able to download this firmware. The Central System supplies in the request an URL where the firmware can be downloaded. The URL also contains the protocol which must be used to download the firmware.

It is recommended that the firmware is downloaded via FTP or FTPS. FTP(S) is better optimized for large binary data than HTTP. Also FTP(S) has the ability to resume downloads. In case a download is interrupted, the Charge Point can resume downloading after the part it already has downloaded. The FTP URL is of format: _ftp://user:password@host:port/path_ in which the parts _user:password@_, _:password_ or _:port_ may be excluded.

To ensure that the correct firmware is downloaded, it is RECOMMENDED that the firmware is also digitally signed.

=== Upload Diagnostics

When a Charge Point is requested to upload a diagnostics file, the Central System supplies in the request an URL where the Charge Point should upload the file. The URL also contains the protocol which must be used to upload the file.

It is recommended that the diagnostics file is downloaded via FTP or FTPS. FTP(S) is better optimized for large binary data than HTTP. Also FTP(S) has the ability to resume uploads. In case an upload is interrupted, the Charge Point can resume uploading after the part it already has uploaded. The FTP URL is of format: _ftp://user:password@host:port/path_ in which the parts _user:password@_, _:password_ or _:port_ may be excluded.

[[standard_configuration_key_names_and_values]]
== Standard Configuration Key Names & Values

Below follows a list of all configuration keys with a role standardized in this specification. The list is separated by <<feature_profiles,Feature Profiles>>. A required configuration key mentioned under a particular profile only has to be supported by the Charge Point if it supports that profile.

For optional Configuration Keys with a boolean type, the following rules apply for the configuration key in the response to a <<get_configuration_req,GetConfiguration.req>> without a list of keys:

* If the key is present, the Charge Point provides the functionality that is configured by the key, and it can be enabled or disabled by setting the value for the key.
* If the key is not present, the Charge Point does not provide the functionality that can be configured by the key.

The "Accessibility" property shows if the value for a certain configuration key is read-only ("R") or read-write ("RW"). In case the key is read-only, the Central System can read the value for the key using <<get_configuration_by_central_system,GetConfiguration>>, but not write it. In case the accessibility is read-write, the Central System can also write the value for the key using <<change_configuration_by_central_system,ChangeConfiguration>>.

|**Type** |integer
|**Unit** |seconds
|**Description** |Size (in seconds) of the clock-aligned data interval. This is the size (in seconds) of the set of evenly spaced aggregation intervals per day, starting at 00:00:00 (midnight). For example, a value of 900 (15 minutes) indicates that every day should be broken into 96 15-minute intervals. + 
When clock aligned data is being transmitted, the interval in question is identified by the start time and (optional) duration interval value, represented according to the ISO8601 standard. All "per-period" data (e.g. energy readings) should be accumulated (for "flow" type measurands such as energy), or averaged (for other values) across the entire interval (or partial interval, at the beginning or end of a Transaction), and transmitted (if so enabled) at the end of each interval, bearing the interval start time timestamp. + 
A value of "0" (numeric zero), by convention, is to be interpreted to mean that no clock-aligned data should be transmitted.

[[appendix_a_new_in_ocpp_1_6]]
== Appendix A: New in OCPP 1.6

The following changes are made in OCPP 1.6 compared to OCPP 1.5 [OCPP1.5]:

* Smart Charging is added
* A binding to JSON over WebSocket as a transport protocol is added, reducing data usage and enabling OCPP communication through NAT routers, see: <<ocpp_imp_j,OCPP JSON Specification>>
* Extra statuses are added to the <<charge_point_status,ChargePointStatus>> enumeration, giving the CPO and ultimately end-users more information about the current status of a Charge Point
* Structure of MeterValues.req is changed to eliminate use of XML Attributes, this is needed for support of JSON (no attribute support in JSON).
* Extra values are added to the <<measurand,Measurand>> enumeration, giving Charge Point manufacturers the possibility to send new information to a Central System, such as the State of Charge of an EV
* The <<trigger_message_req,TriggerMessage>> message is added, giving the Central System the possibility to request information from the Charge Point
* A new _Pending_ member is added to the <<registration_status,RegistrationStatus>> enumeration used in <<boot_notification_conf,BootNotification.conf>>
* More and clearer configuration keys are added, making it clearer to the CPO how to configure the different business cases in a Charge Point
* The messages and configuration keys are split into profiles, making it easier to implement OCPP gradually or only in part
* Known ambiguities are removed (e.g. when to use <<unlock_connector_req,UnlockConnector.req>>, how to respond to <<remote_start_transaction_req,RemoteStart>>/<<remote_stop_transaction_req,Stop>>, Connector numbering)
